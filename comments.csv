If all you ever use is a browser, and you write your letters in Google Docs or by hand, go for it! As long as you don't put it in developer mode, the only way to get malware onto it is shitty extensions/apps, and that's a) relatively easy to clean up b) not that likely since Google is doing an increasingly better job at cleaning up the Chrome web store.

I would never get a Chromebook as my main computer because I do far too much advanced stuff that simply wouldn't work on it (software development, running virtual machines, ...), but if a relative asks me for ""a computer"" that I would have to support, they're getting a Chromebook unless they can demonstrate proficiency in something that wouldn't work on it, and a history of actually using that application.

The only Apple computer that EVER 'leads the pack' in CPU performance is the Mac Pro, and even then they generally aren't using THE 'latest and greatest' Xeons that Intel sells.

- Question 1. Yes. All details are 100% correct.
- Question 2. yes on the same (non dominant) wrist
- Question 3. Thanks for this. I'll give it a few weeks. It's just so disheartening to see the drop in activity. I also did not set a new account. I've kept my old account and updated my device.

197,"The Up24/Up-Move use the Fullpower Technologies' MotionX algorithms, while UP2/3/4 use Jawbone developed Algorithms. I wear an Up3 and Up-Move on the same wrist, just to track how closely they match; and usually they are well within 10-15% of one another.
Now, before blaming the algorithms or sensors, let's do a dumb-user check:
Q1: Because you had to use a different App with Up2 rather than  UP24; did you remember to set your height, weight, and gender correctly when setting up your UP2? -- the height and weight are critical (for any fitness tracker) to determining how much wrist movement is actually a step.
Q2: Are you wearing the UP2 on the same wrist as you were wearing your UP24? Ideally, it should not matter: but remember, it is trying to figure out your steps by your wrist movement. So, heavy keyboard or smart-phone usage is a major source of errors with these things.
Q3: New trackers are always less accurate the first 2 weeks of operation. The new account/new tracker needs time to ""learn"" your patterns of movement. Back a few years ago, when I got my first UP24, I remember how horribly inaccurate the sleep and step counting ""seemed"" to be for the first week. (very little sleep and very few steps counted) And, after 2 weeks, I remember it began to become a lot more realistic. When the UP24 died and I replaced it with a new UP24; I was using the same account and so no new learning was needed. ... but when switching from 24 to UP3, the new App and new account needed a few weeks of training again.",Jawbone,2
198,"My alarm would fuck up too. I felt so ripped off. I still use my up 2 but it's disappointing. 

I work retail and with my old band, it would show 10k steps or more no problem and it felt accurate because I'm on my feet constantly. Now I barely break 6k and I'm not any less active. 

I'm so so disappointed too. What disappointed me more was jawbones response to my problems. ",Jawbone,1
