I am old and used a lot of software and Google Photos is the most incredible software application I have ever used.   It is a big statement but I am serious.

137,"I'll go back to my biggest fanboy roots, and quote Babylon 5 as a standard. They produced in widescreen, one of the first on TV to do so, while broadcast was still limited to 4:3. Unfortunately, the budget didn't extend to producing CG in 16:9 or 1080p. Now, with the original CG models lost (set pieces added by CG in addition to space battles), there is no possible Blu-Ray release or remaster.

Babylon 5 is the best TV series to ever be made, telling a complex and deep story over many years, with actors that can never be replaced in roles than will, and do, transcend ""relevance"" discussions.

These producers, not filming with the equipment of the day (like 4K cameras, which even the iPhone 6 has), will be lost to irrelevance, even if they don't deserve it. Peter Jackson adopted a double framerate for The Hobbit. If the rest haven't even moved to 4K, which is very affordable, even for a hobbyist (Apple makes the camera!) then it is their shame, not Apple or the industry's.

EDIT: Producers and Filmmakers need to understand that, today, consumers will watch their films on 4K sets, whether it be by projection in a theatre or at home. If they haven't recognized that, then how can their film be worth watching? The best filmmakers have recognized the medium by which their films will be watched and adapted, like James Cameron with Avatar. The rest...?

Sure, it can be expensive, but productions that cost less than at least $2-3M will never be seen by the general public, so a $250k investment (which studios, should those producers ever manage to be affiliated, can lend out) should not be considered massive, especially when that cost can be realistically ascertained at less than $50k. And with an iPhone, that's less than $749. You'll find exceptions, like Primer, that were produced with tiny budgets and equipment at hand, but they are not for the general public until they find a fan/cult on Netflix, who are prioritized by more than just merit, but by the sets it is watched on.

We are arguing at crossed purposes, though. Things that deserve to be seen by everyone have the latest camera tech behind them, provided by people or companies who deem the content worthwhile, or by budgets that deem the content worthwhile.

Otherwise, they can film on iPhones until someone with money decide it's worth it.

EDIT: Or, they pick the out-of-production film of 30 years ago to try and add a USP to their film, relinquishing their production to the annals of, ""That was stupid, wasn't it?"", instead of being featured on Netflix or Apple Video's ""Best Viewed in 4k"" channel.",Apple,1449096684.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3v5xla/apple_should_really_add_the_recently_released_4k/cxkynyd,1,370 :: Apple should really add the recently released 4K NASA footage of the s...

171,"Well, iMessage is a huge factor in my decision.  Girls actually called me out for having green bubbles in texts.  Also, I am looking at working at a couple of tech start ups.  Most of these start ups treat Android as a second class user, if they make a client at all.  

The uniformity and stability is another massive draw for me.  On my OnePlus One Cyanogen Inc(not to be confused with cyanogenmod, love the community there) has been neglecting the phone even though it was promised quick updates.  These updates are packed with bloatware, such as Truecaller app which is an opt out app that uploads my contacts to their servers.  This should not be the case.  

So, that means I had to unlock the bootloader and use community ROMs.  That in and of itself is fine, I enjoyed them.  Sultan XDA created a fabulous OPO rom, and he updated it multiple times per week.  Great Rom, but updates and having to ensure the correct version of xposed was flashed started to become a pain.  Some xposed modules would cause a bootloop, which was a hassle.

The lack of a non root backup process (sort of fixed with marshmellow, since the app maker must now target the API and opt in for back ups) was rather frustrating.  

Another major issue (Google always claims that it is fixing with the new update, if it ever even reaches your phone) is battery life.  Especially standby battery life.  Some apps will randomly trigger wake locks and drain my battery 30+% overnight, as opposed to the usual 3-7%. 

The long story is that google provides wonderful services, I love chrome, gmail, google maps, google photos, drive, you name it.  But these services are available to iOS.  

Apple offers me clean crisp photos.  Great battery life (iOS and Android apps have very different restrictions or lack thereof while running in the background.  App selection is superior, especially when it comes to new start ups.  Crashes are not a concern as far as I am aware.  Tech support is another huge factor, not that I am likely to ever need it, but warranty support is second to none.  

Honestly, if google had created a rival to iMessage I probably wouldn't have ordered an iPhone.  Google fails to deliver on many promises with android.  Maybe in a couple years they will have dealt with major issues, but until then, I look forward to my iPhone.

209,"I'm one of them.  I'm tired of Android phones' continual climb in size.  The 6s is about as big as I want to deal with, and has great resale value, so I figure I'll deal with it until there's a smaller Nexus, Moto, or Xperia phone.

So far... it's meh.  My phone seems to freeze as often as my Android phone did.  There are a couple of apps (the Google Search app, Instagram, Apple's News app, and the built-in search that you swipe left from the home screen to see) that seem to put network IO on the UI thread so sometimes they do nothing when you tap something on the screen (like the Instagram inbox).

I really hate not being able to put icons where I want on the home screen.  It's a pain to get everything organized as you want since they spill over in a certain fashion.

I'm not as bothered by the lack of app defaults as I thought I would be.  The only place it annoys me is when you swipe left to the built-in search stuff and it uses whatever Search Apple wants, and when you click the map toggles it uses Apple maps.  Everywhere else, though, the app you're trying to share with seems to let you pick how to open the thing you want to share.

Siri is bad.  I just moved the google search app to one of the 4 default apps on the bottom of the screen, and that works just as well for me.  Except that sometimes when I tap the mic, it doesn't seem to be paying attention, or there's a lag before it will listen.  Weird.  Again, this phone is not as fast as I would have expected.

The biggest thing I miss is still customization.  It annoys me that I can't have my phone switch to vibrate mode automatically when I walk into (within certain distance of) my office, so I just leave the physical vibrate switch on all the time.   

I don't how notifications work.  When my phone buzzes on the table in a meeting, I can't tap (or wave above it) to see a summary of the message.  Pressing the home button just unlocks it (finger reader is fast), and now I have to swipe down and over to see the notification or go to Outlook directly, or awkwardly tap the power button on the side of the phone, or use one of the 4 fingers I haven't tied to the fingerprint unlock.  I also don't like how they don't show at the top of the screen unless I swipe down.

My 6s won't automatically read me my text messages when it detects I'm driving and allow me to dictate a reply.  I guess they assume your car will do this for you via a bluetooth hookup (which the next car I buy will have).  That was a surprise.

There are no good Spades apps.  I've tried five so far, and none compare to my favorite Spades app on Android.  They all seem to prioritize flashy graphics over gameplay (you have to swipe a card to play it and everything has gradients vs fast dealing and LOTS of game modes and settings to tweak AI).  This is minor, I know.

The camera is nice, but HDR doesn't work as well as it did on my 2013 Moto X (in terms of light/dark balance - the image itself is WAY clearer).

The battery life isn't much better.

The stock keyboard is bad, but that's probably just an issue of how used to it I am.  I'm glad I was able to install Swiftkey.  The iOS version of Swiftkey isn't as good, though.  I can't long-press keys to get to additional punctuation or numbers (much less control the length of that longpress in settings).

The force-touch thing is a non-issue.  I've never used it as a shortcut from the home screen, and I've never been able to get those ""live"" photos to work.",Apple,1449077578.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3v5bm1/iphone_6s_has_drawn_a_record_percentage_of/cxkkon4,36,242 :: iPhone 6s has drawn a record percentage of Android switchers

If you have the patience, use Quicktime and a Lightning cable to record you opening Spotlight at native res 60FPS. Then upload the file to some cloud service that won't re-encode the video (i.e. not YouTube). I'll show you the exact frames that are dropped.

406,"**8. Switching Power Supplies in PCs:**  Steve Jobs insisted the Apple II include a switching power supply which offer a number of advantages of cheaper linear power supplies.

**9. Retina Displays on Phones:** When the iPhone 4 came out, High DPI screens that small pretty much didn't exist.

**10. Retina displays on PCs:** Prior to the rMBP, the only ultra high resolution Displays you could get for a PC were medical grade displays used in Radiology and other stuff, or an IBM monitor that was extraordinarily expensive.  Of course you could forget about proper scaling or software to render the OS in an intuitive way.

**11. Thunderbolt:** Apple Debuted intel's Light Peak Technology on its Macbook Pro, giving unprecedented 10Gb/s bidirectional transfer of files, audio throughput, and video throughput, and I believe ethernet throughput.  It also came out with a display that would serve as a dock using only a single cable.  I can think of no better implementation of this technology.

**12. Hard Disk based Music Players:** Yes they technically existed, but as Steve Jobs put it their interface was shit.  Apple came up with an interface to navigate 5GB worth of music, the software on the computer to organize it all, and the interface to transfer all those files... namely:

**13. iEEE 1394 (Firewire):**  Which apple actually invented.  While USB 1.1 was chugging along at 12 Mbps, here comes Firewire with a full 400 Mbps, daisy chaining, peer-to-peer communication, hot-swapping, plug-and-play, and up to 45 watts (at up to 30V) of power, along with a number of other improvements over SCSI and USB.

**14. The PC as the Digital Hub:** This was apple's vision for the PC in the early 21st century.  More than just an internet web browser, email machine, office machine, the idea was that the PC would link all your digital content (Music, Movies, Photos, etc.).  Apple brought a suite of programs to Mac users that allowed them to easily create, organize, store, and share digital movies, photos, and music.  This takes vision to dedicate an entire team to develop a suite of apps that would be included for free on every PC sold, that would work together, and set the Mac brand apart.  To do this; to dedicate the resources to setting all this up knowing it will be profitable in the long run takes what Steve Jobs was best at *vision*.

**15. PCs that didn't look like office equipment**:  Remember your first PC?  Unless you're a teenager, it probably looked like a fax machine.  Then comes the iMac in all colors of the rainbow.  Since then computers have adopted all sorts of neat and interesting shapes/sizes/designs, including and especially gaming people who love to shit all over apple.  Where do you think this started from?  Fax machines still look like fax machines.

**16. PC All-In-One systems (Apple I)**: The apple I wasn't the first computer, but it was the first one where all you needed was a TV and a keyboard to get to work programming the thing.  Apple has continued the tradition of all-in-one computing, and produces the only good all-in-one computer on the market.

**17. Shared Cooling Core for PCs**: Why do you need a separate fan and heatsink for the graphics card, CPU, and Hard Drive?  Just put it into a unified core, save a massive amount of space.

**18. Buttonless Multitouch Trackpads:**  This one is so intuitive it hurts.  Two-Finger right clicking and scrolling, zooming, gestures, apple implemented these so well they sell a separate trackpad for their Desktops.  It's crazy!  No other vendor comes close to apple's driver's.

**19. Unibody Laptop Enclosures**: Apple had close to if not the best laptop hardware with their Powerbook G4/Macbook Pro.  Then the unibody design took it to an entirely new level.  No other laptop maker comes close.

**20. Digital Media Players (Nothing existed in 2007)**:  Seriously, I think I'm right in saying that in 2007 when the AppleTV came out the desktop media player industry didn't exist.  Now they're everywhere.  Unfortunately I don't think apple is implementing this *nearly* as well as they could be.

**21. Fusion drives (dedicated SSD + dedicated HDD)**:  Yes SSHD's exist, and yes windows offers some ""plug in a thumb drive and we'll make your computer faster"" tech, but nobody ships computers with dedicated SSDs and HDDs with software to take advantage of the SSDs higher speed, on a system-wide level.

**22. Fonts**: Steve Jobs brought this with him after apparently being captivated by a calligraphy course he took in college.  Then he implemented a way to take those fonts from the screen onto a piece of paper with their Dot-Matrix printers.  Could you imagine Microsoft or IBM coming up with fonts?!

**23. Quicktime Streaming Server**: An easy way for media to be streamed from pretty much any computer to any computer via the internet.  In 1999.

**24. iChat AV + iSight**: Remember the old days of those shitty USB webcams with their shitty interfaces, and their shitty way of connecting people to get some shitty grainy image to someone else?  Yeah, and then there was iChat AV and Apple's iSight.  In fact the original iSight camera was so good they still fetch a pretty penny on ebay.

**25. Wifi**:  Just read [this](http://www.economist.com/node/2724397).

453,"To everyone commenting sarcastic comments implying that people need to cut Apple some slack, if you have a new Apple TV, you know that this is a SERIOUS problem hindering the usability of the whole device. The fact of the matter is, the PATHETIC keyboard on the Apple TV is Apple Maps bad. If you haven't tried it, imagine how long it takes to peck out a word with nothing but a line of all the letters in front of you. It's more than just passwords that are effected, it's the whole interface. I realise the Siri remote solves some of the problems with this, yet first, Siri isn't available in all regions, and it is still frustrating if you ever want to type something out.

476,"> Alternative ways to sync/manage your iOS devices? No.

It depends on what you mean by sync/manage.  You could iCloud everything (contacts, notes, photos, etc...) and then use something like Plex which has apps for iPhone/iPad, Mac, and even now the Apple TV.  Not to mention it's cross platform, which would include Linux, Windows, Android as well as other set top boxes and smart TVs.

With this set up, you wouldn't need to have iTunes at all to get music and videos (and photos) on your iOS device either downloaded, or streamed (either from your own Mac/PC or from a personal cloud device or seedbox).

Even better, you can import iTunes into Plex, and even continue to use your iTunes library and have Plex update as iTunes does.

That said, and as much as I absolutely friggin love Plex, while there are many benefits to using it (especially if you're a fan of meta data), you're going to find yourself making a lot of tradeoffs between the two.  I still find iTunes to be superior in ways that matter most to me (as well as superior to other Mac/PC apps).

But check out Plex and see what you think, you might prefer it in ways that I don't... I just love it as a media server and find it useful as something that coexists with iTunes.",Apple,1449143193.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3v86wp/are_there_any_viable_itunes_alternatives_for_os_x/cxlk21b,1,24 :: Are there any viable iTunes alternatives for OS X?

Good news: Smartplayer for the phone is a better music player than the Apple one in every way that I use it. It is simple, beautiful, and uses gestures to navigate while it is playing.

519,"I was concerned about this initially as a match subscriber, and planned on having both. 

Then I realized that Apple can't add DRM to anything I bought in iTunes or that doesn't match to anything in Apple Music, such as my friend's indie album, live bootleg albums, EP's, b-sides downloaded from the net, etc.

And that also opens up a workaround which is to alter the titles of the stuff that you don't want to match. You can even just add a . and it should work. I haven't tested it but I'm pretty sure they match exact names. 

Anything else that I downloaded illegally or got from a friend on USB, or imported a CD I owned, if DRM is added to it, that means it's available on Apple Music to stream anyways so I don't need the original DRM free file, because I'm paying for a service that gives me access to such music. 

It's not like you lose the ability to play the songs. You just can't take them with you when you cancel, but first of all its not like you have a limited subscription. There should be no reason to cancel and if you do, you could just illegally download the stuff you want back.

There's a pretty good chance that if you have a 10,000+ song library (yo), it's mostly remnants from the pre-streaming days when the most robust and convenient way to listen to new music and listen to music you like was to own it. Does that mean that all 10,000+ songs are songs that, to this day, you feel the need to own? 

Not me. If I cancelled streaming and had to go back to carefully picking and choosing what I own, I'd probably narrow it down to a lot less, such that I could spend a day torrenting away. 

Whenever I want to listen to something in the future but don't have it, I'll just torrent that one thing that day, and then I have it forever and my library grows. But you wouldn't need to torrent those 10,000+ back immediately. You couldn't even listen to that many songs in such a short time. 

And it's good to just back it all up on a 1 tb external drive anyways to avoid all the trouble.

Before Apple Music, I already have 15GB worth of music on my device. I always sync my iPhone in iTunes first before I turn on iCloud Music Library (iCML) since enabling iCML on your iOS device has a side effect that you can no longer do manual sync between your phone and iTunes—everything you add manually from iTunes has to go through the cloud now and it will automatically download on your phone.

528,"Apple has had WiFi issues for over a year. One thread on their forums, started in September 2014, has over 1 million views and 3,300 replies. Search Twitter for ""iPhone wifi dropping"" and you'll see how common it is. No software update has addressed it. I started having WiFi issues when I got my iPhone 6 in March. It would connect, use the WiFi, randomly switch to LTE (while still staying connected), then grab the WiFi again after a few minutes. I tried resetting network settings, enabling/disabling WiFi Assist, WiFi Calling, disabling WiFi Networking, even resetting the entire device -- nothing worked. I tried changing my router channels, both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, to various combinations. I added the iPhone's MAC Address to the 5 GHz block list, forcing it to get the 2.4 GHz WiFi. Again, nothing worked.

Finally, I bring my phone in to Apple yesterday, I swipe through screenshots showing how it cuts in and out, the guy says, ""Yeah, I can see how that'd be frustrating, you're under warranty, so we'll get you a new phone."" I return home and the new phone starts doing the same thing. I have concluded it's not the router and it's nothing in the phone settings, I'm thinking it has to be the WiFi chip or whatever they put in there that's just absolutely horrendous. 

Not a good look by Apple, frustrating to me since this is the first Apple product I've ever owned. I've had data caps come into play since my phone can't hold the dang connection. It's really a shame because I love the phone, but the WiFi problems seem to be too common and have gone uncorrected for too long that I can't see myself staying with the iPhone when I'm eligible to upgrade.

End of rant.

For your situation, since it all happened at the same time I'd reboot the router or reset to defaults and reset network settings on the devices.

Speaking as a 20yr IT Guy.....

Wi-Fi is a notoriously complex and difficult thing to troubleshoot.. and the vast majority of complaints/forums you see of people saying ""I'm having Wi-Fi problems"" ---- have no fucking idea what they're talking about. (at least.. the vast majority of those people don't). And most people are INCREDIBLY bad/sloppy/incomplete with their troubleshooting (if they do any at all.. which most do not). 

Wi-Fi can be effected by a wide variety of things:

* The Make/Model/Version/Age/Quality of your Router. 

* The configuration (Settings & Firmware) of your Router

* The location of your Router

* The amount of devices going through your Router (IE = The amount of Power your Router has to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal... drops as more and more devices connect)

* The environment you're in (distance, obstacles, interference, etc)

* The client devices you have (Operating System.. Wi-Fi chipset, Wi-Fi Drivers, size/shape/design of internal antenna,etc) 

I'm not trying to defend Apple -- because they certainly HAVE had their share of Wi-Fi issues (like the so-called ""WiFried"" issue (https://medium.com/@mariociabarra/wifried-ios-8-wifi-performance-issues-3029a164ce94#.e52zvcm1h ) as well as retiring mDNSResponder and replacing it with DiscoveryD ..... but even given the merit of those issues.... looking at a forum of ""3,300 complaints"" and just taking it at face value that all of those 3,300 complaints are all caused by the same root problem... is disingenuous at best. (and grossly misleading/incorrect at worst).

564,"1. Mute switch shouldn't affect alarms; those should go off regardless. They are tied to your ringer volume so as long as your ringer is turned up, they should sound. Unsure right now why that would happen other than a bug.

2. With iOS 9 and Xcode 7 on a Mac, you can compile open-source apps and run them on your phone. You cannot, however, just sideload arbitrary apps.

3. The first day or so can be a bit worse, but it shouldn't really be an issue after that. If battery does seem low, I recommend checking Settings > Battery to see what apps or features are consuming your battery. I also recommend keeping auto-brightness on, keep the brightness lower rather than higher so long as it's still readable, and keep auto-lock (Settings > General > Auto-Lock) set to as low a time as you can tolerate.

2. Yes, you can of course jailbreak. Other method requires a Mac or OSX virtual machine with Xcode. You just open the app and Xcode and build it. Xcode would then install the app on your device

3. 6S+ should be destroying Nexus 6's battery. I usually only got 3hr SOT with the N6. Double check that all your apps say ""use my location while open"" in privacy settings.

The location thing was just a thought, 6S+ has one of the top battery life's so Im not sure why your experiencing that. iOS's control of background apps is really strict but there are a handful that could over pull for location.

On my first AirBnB visit I had no idea that a four star rating was truly sub par.  They had a bunch of carpet stains that were really bad in the living room, but the location was good and the rest of the place was really nice.  I liked the hosts but I thought people should be warned about the stains. (they were pretty bad)  I guess I still might review that as a 4 star just to be honest, but if I knew it meant so much to the nice hosts, I might have hesitated more.

1) you are going to cancel because there is no facilities for washing clothes in the building?  While it's not correct of the host to list an amenity and then not provide it, it doesn't seem to merit a cancellation.  Is there something else going on?
2) why did you agree to pay a deposit in cash?  that is something that in hindsight you probably realize that you shouldn't have done.  

You can of course call Airbnb directly, and if you don't feel comfortable talking to the host directly, then let them know.   

But to me this indicates that you may prefer a more traditional arrangements such as a hotel, where there is more anonymity and you have a staffed front desk that can help you.

As far as the cash deposit goes, you won't get it back from Airbnb as they were not part of that transaction.

805,"There is more going on yes, there was incredibly loud music that kept going and kept me awake till 6am, I had breakfast and needed to have my laundry done since I was out of clean clothes, so I emailed my host about it. No response, I waited for staff to arrive but none did. I emailed and called again but couldn't reach him. He assured me before booking that there was a washing machine in the building but I looked through it and could not find. Eventually I was able to reach him by phone and he said staff would come maybe today or tomorrow and do my laundry from my room. 

I don't want people coming and going through my room without me knowing about it, I don't want have to chase down hosts and staff when I need my clothes cleaned. I am irritable because I haven't been able to sleep because this had to be taken care of today so I would have something to wear tomorrow. 

I told him I didn't want them coming to my room so he said he would call them and arrange something, then let me know by email. I didn't receive any email from him and after awhile called again, he said the same thing and an hour after that call I received an email finally saying after yet another hour staff would come by. 

So I find out the washing machine he mentioned in the building is behind locked doors and only for when you pay for the staff to do it for you. So I just finished waiting for that,  my clothes are drying on the balcony and it is 16:30......and the music is starting again. It also started around this time yesterday. 

I'm not going to be sleep tonight if this music continues like it did last night, I wasn't able to sleep today because I was chasing down hosts and staff and I had paid the cash deposit when I landed because I had nowhere to live in a strange country except this listing I had arranged. 

I've also wasted more than a day of my vacation on this and in the future I'll have to sit around and coordinate with staff to have my clothes cleaned and waste more time.

2 When wearing it for a long time I've got a slight imprint on my arm but nothing painful. Remember you don't need to wear it super tight, it should be slightly loose.  

It's the same for me with the loose sides. I'm right on the edge between a small size and a large and picked the large as suggested by Fitbit. It hasn't caused me any issues yet, only maybe with clothing sleeves going over it.

3 I have heard people wearing it on the ankle yeah, I remember them saying it works. No idea of the tracking when not wearing.   

4 Doubtful about this since the tracker uses your heart rate & movement to detect whether you're asleep or not. I guess it could still detect movement while off but not sure if it actually does.

If windows 10 can get better app support then the mobile space may change a bit but I think it's hard to get people out of their comfort zones with phones. I looked at the windows phones but just didn't want to make the jump.,Microsoft,1449095366.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/3v58x3/apple_approved_microsoft_filming_new/cxkxr6h,6,82 :: Apple approved Microsoft filming new holiday-themed ad outside iconic N...

960,"First off, with W10M - I am in the minority now who adores his Lumia 830, and has had many iPhone, Android and Windows Phone alike. Right now, this platform isn't and may never be a consumer OS from here on in - many analysts and Microsoft fans agree that this has become a niche platform and that Microsoft has spread out to iOS and Android to counteract their own OS not hitting the mainstream. As far as the 24 month comment goes, regarding W10M, I believe this to be a possibility - despite many college students and such my age alike being shown the platform and taking a likening to it before hearing of ""app gap"". I myself have a Moto X Pure Edition and iPhone 6 on standby for such a reason. Second off - The Surface line is FLOURISHING amongst many my ages and is showing strong interest in IT/Enterprise use in the near future. Hell, I can't go anywhere on my campus anymore without seeing at least a Surface or two, a number vastly growing as the hardware gets better and begins to stack up with the MacBook Pro at a consumer level, not to mention the hundreds of other Windows PCs I constantly see everywhere else in the world. If Microsoft is going under in two years, ignoring the fact that Windows 7/8/XP/10 is the workhorse behind most enterprise and consumer computers, I along with millions of individuals and businesses missed this memo and I have no idea how my workplace will recuperate from such an impending ""disaster"". Thirdly, regarding Xbox - this is clearly ignorant and deserves its own rant altogether. Not only has the UI been revised and countless exclusives and deals have been released, but the Xbox One is selling even better than the Xbox 360 did a decade ago, which was the most popular console at the time before the Wii fad kicked in. Just because Xbox is number two right now does not mean it is failing in the SLIGHTEST - again, ignorance ;) I may not like some of the shit Microsoft does and they really have dropped the ball on tons of things, but they still have leading PC operating systems, sell and make millions off software licenses, have a dominant lead in Enterprise that Mac OS X and Linux can presently not dream of penetrating for anything other than network and graphic purposes, and a gaming console that is still selling incredibly well. And if they are becoming the new IBM, hell, sell them to Lenovo too - the ThinkPad line in the eyes of many has improved since the IBM acquisition by Lenovo. So fine, maybe you aren't trolling. But you are wrong, and both numbers and opinion only show this to be true.",Microsoft,1449095660.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/3v58x3/apple_approved_microsoft_filming_new/cxkxydf,3,82 :: Apple approved Microsoft filming new holiday-themed ad outside iconic N...

I work in a computer shop, and we see the ones that failed.

For the future, I have a couple of suggestions to make the process better: 

1) have the end user BACK UP first, onto an external drive.

2) run a hardware diagnostic, to make sure the hard drive isn't about to go.

3) make sure the drivers are available.

4) update to Win10.

For #2 if you search the album instead of the artist, it will only queue that album i'm pretty sure, if you are playing from the artists page, it will queue that artist.

 #3 No i don't think so. I've been using it for a while and i haven't seen anything like that yet!

 #5 If you click Edit on the top right of your phone on the radio section, a small x will appear in the top right to delete, I have yet to find a way to do it on the computer.

General advice and sort of subtle features are you can change songs from your phone even if they are playing from your computer, available offline, playlist folders, you can copy and paste songs.

Also a good way to play songs and albums in the order that you want in the order that you want is just adding them all to a playlist, and playing without shuffle!

1113,"Hey! 

Asana is super useful! Love their developers! I have heard from some people though that Asana can be limited to scheduling, rather than actually processing tasks. Still love it!

Evernote also just came out with a sort of template regime: https://help.evernote.com/hc/articles/209006007 

If you are thinking of trying Asana read on and learn a bit more about the tools!

Most entrepreneurs will tell you that time-tracking and project management tools help them not only stay effective, but also become more successful. 

What you choose for yourself or your team really depends upon three facts: 

1. How willing you are to let go of your current software, and utilize and all-in-one tool to become more efficient. 

2. The vertical in which you and your business operates. 

3. How much flexibility and creativity you want within the program. Most, if not all successful startups deal with a need for effective process management, workflow, and organization.

With something like Transpose, you can create solutions such as templates, records, and notes. You can track orders, view inventory, enhance projects and manage content. With a simple drag-n-drop editor you get to pick from a wide selection of data fields including dates, time, files, contacts or even transcribed voice recording.

Here are some examples of what something like Transpose can do!

**IT Management:** * Smart Database for Asset Management * Help Desk Ticket and Tracker Forms * Office Relocation Records (and request online form) * Asset Management (Barcode reader in iOS and Android) * Servers, Logins/Accounts.

**Operation & Company Management:** * Web Forms for Work Orders * Voice Field for Recording Sales Meetings * Company Goals Tracker * Team Objectives Tracker * Team Vacation Planner * Meeting Agenda * Attendance and Follow Up * Meeting Action Items Tracker * Simple Project Task List.

**Sales and Marketing:** * Sales Pipeline * Customer Needs Analysis * Outbound Sales Campaign plan * Sales Activity Tracker * Share Customer Contact List * Sales Pipeline By Rep, By Size, By Stage, By Summary (view) * Customer Needs Analysis * Content Marketing: Running a Business Blog * Marketing Campaign Analysis * Marketing Quarterly Goals * Marketing Team Objectives * Sales Activity Tracker (by rep and month) * Shared Customer Contact List and Form * Sales Training Development Guide * Content Calendar/ Blogging Calendar/ Long Form Content * Event Plan and Budget * Event Registration Web Form * PR Activity Tracker * PR Event Tracker * PR Coverage Tracker * PPC Advertising Recurring Tasks Tracker * Website Change Request Tracker and Web Form

**Human Resources:** * Web Forms to Submit Resumes, Time-off Requests, Suggestion Box, Scheduling Meetings * Kanban For Applicant Tracking * Smart Database For Job Description Organizing * Calendar For Holidays, Time-off * Record Interviews * Organize Performance Reviews * Assigned To Field * Job Application Web Form * Applicant Tracker * Resume Upload and Application Web Form * New Hire Checklist * Employee Objectives and Performance Reviews * Employee Review Checklist * Employee Directory * Employee Termination Documentation * Monthly Personnel Activity Tracker * Interview Process/Workflow * Internal Job Requisition Form * Suggestion Box With Web Form

**Project Management and Product Development:** * Kanban For Project Management * Collaboration For Teams * Feature Backlog and Prioritization * Agile Software * Issues and Bug Tracker * Product User Feedback Online

**Also Employee/Team Productivity and Finance**

So please try them all! See what you like best! 

There are a number of other apps like Trello, Notable, JIRA and others but each would give you one view for your data; on kanban boards, in spreadsheets or calendars, you would have to connect all those different apps together though with something like Zapier or IFTTT to send and duplicate data between them all. Transpose offers those views as well and using the same data you already have. Check it out! would love to know what do you think..

But if you would prefer to keep everything in Slack, there is only one peice of advise I can give you. There should be an influental manager on your team whose word is unshakable. That person should tell everybody that you are not using e-mails for internal conversation ANYMORE. Everything is now done through Slack only.
