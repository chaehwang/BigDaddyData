Or maybe use a short USB 3.1 cable as video in, from the video out of the eGPU (the flow would be TB3 out -> eGPU in -> eGPU USB3.1 out -> USB 3.1 (or another TB) in -> done).\\n\\nAnyhow it seems like a very small engineering challenge, it's just routing a cable somewhere.\\n\\nAlso remember that with DX12 for instance, you can use both the iGPU and dGPU (or eGPU) at the same time, which means you will probably be able to use either video out (the one from the motherboard, or the one from the GPU).\",\n",

Apple were front runners with TB 1 & 2 and now they lag behind PC OEMs. :(\\n\\nBecause the ultraportable devices with TB3 have Broadwell which is not available in a desktop form, you would have to use a Skylake chip which hasn't really hit the market too well outside of the K enthusiast chips.\\n\\nTB3 requires a particular pcie configuration as it is requiring more and more lanes with every generation.

       " u\"> Do you have more info on Broadwell supporting Thunderbolt 3.0 though? \\n\\nThunderbolt still is, and will probably be for quite a while a separate chipset. The CPU doesn't directly dictate support(yet), the board design and available PCI-E lanes do.\\n\\nThe problem with the Mac Pro is that they use Xeons, which will be running Broadwell-e not skylake. However, the high end Xeons should have enough PCI-E lane availability to support a chipset upgrade.\",\n",

       " u\"Well, it's not like Alienware's custom, proprietary PCI connection is ever going to take off, so it doesn't matter.\",\n",
       " u'My guess is that they want to launch TB3 on one of their flagship \"pro\" models. After all, TB1 was first released on the MacBook Pro, and TB2 came in on the Mac Pro. \\n\\nAs nice as the retina iMacs are, laptops are the real money makers for the Mac, and it makes sense that Apple would want to hype them up with as exclusive new tech as possible.

       " u\"I highly doubt they're going to wait that long...\\n\\nMac Pros use Xeon E5s, which generally launch about a year after the mainstream chips for any given generation. We're still waiting on Broadwell Xeon E5s to come in maybe Q1 or Q2 of 2016. Skylake Xeon E5s aren't coming until Q3 or Q4 2016, and that's when we'll get Thunderbolt 3.0 in the Mac Pro. \",\n",

       " u\"That's what's kind of worrying. Can they really hold out until...late 2016?\",\n",
       " u\"Right. Personally I think we'll see a Broadwell based Mac Pro in early 2016, and the a Skylake based Mac Pro in late 2017. \",\n",
       " u'With how long the tower Mac pro stuck around, I doubt that. I could see them waiting till 2017 but if they update in 2016 then I doubt they will again the next year. ',\n",

       " u'I\\'d the lack of mac upgradability has more to do with making things combat/small/thin than greed. An external GPU would be even more freeing to the 15\" MBP because they could then eliminate the design constraint of fitting a mobile GPU in them. And clearly apple kinda hates having to put up with nvidia/amd graphics based on outdated the ones they use are. \\n\\nI bet thats Apple\\'s plan, release iGPU only MBPs alongside a sleek aluminum enclosure and workstation grade FirePro cards built in. ',\n",
       " u\"The new Mac mini and 21 inch iMac have the same designs as the previous generations, but both moved to soldered ram. It's not just about making things smaller. It's a business decision. \",\n",
       " u\"Yep, Apple knows that most smart shoppers will buy the base model, then buy RAM on Amazon instead of paying Apple double the price to upgrade.\\n\\nI'd imagine this is why most phone manufacturers are leaving out SD card slots.\",\n",
       " u\"People [have already gotten external GPUs running over Thunderbolt 2](http://www.journaldulapin.com/2013/08/24/a-thunderbolt-gpu-on-a-mac-how-to/) on Apple laptops with minimal performance hit (~80%) and there have been several demonstrations of eGPU TB2 devices at various trade shows. However, none of these have made it to market yet and they've all required a fairly heavy amount of fiddling around by the user, not exactly the plug-and-play ease of use you'd expect to see from Apple. TB3 will allow higher bandwidth and reduce the performance hit from eGPUs even further, which could be the final step that sees eGPUs entering the mainstream.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been waiting so many years for eGPUs to go mainstream.  Now that I think about it, it might be another nail in desktop's coffin.\",\n",
       " u\">going out of its way to prevent upgrading\\n\\nHow so? The form factor of the iMac doesn't lend itself to upgrading, but Apple didn't adopt that form to prevent upgrading. Apple co-developed Thunderbolt and has implemented each successive generation but because TB3 isn't on the new iMacs they are suddenly going out of their way to prevent upgrading? That doesn't make sense.\",\n",
       " u\"On board ram doesn't provide a significant advantage in space, power consumption, or costs.\",\n",
       " u'Thunderbolt ram however...',\n",
       " u'They definitely are trying to prevent upgrading. The new Mac mini has the same design as the old one, but moved to soldered ram. Same with the 21 inch iMac. ',\n",
       " u\"It's far, far more likely that's to cut manufacturing and warranty/support costs on low-end systems, otherwise they would have done that years ago.\",\n",
       " u\"Apple doesn't warranty replaced parts anyway. And if your OEM ram failed, it would be a lot easier and less expensive for Apple to replace that than the entire logic board. \",\n",
       " u\"The only substantive improvement to the current mini, beside the graphics, was a second thunderbolt port. Which significantly increases the ability to upgrade storage, graphics and port selection (through adapters and hubs).\\n\\nIt's not much compared to the locking they did but it does improve the upgradability.\",\n",
       " u\"None of the new laptops allow upgrading, I understand it's small form factor, but that's not really an excuse.\",\n",
       " u'You\\'d be surprised. \\n\\nStarting with the Mac Pro, the substantive add-ons and components for the desktop is achieved not through internal upgrade slots, but through the use of the Thunderbolt 3 extension. \\n\\nSo basically more storage, more functionality and processing performance, through external add-ons. \\n\\nA dGPU would allow this to happen, especially for a \\'Pro\\'-tier laptop like the rMBP 14\". In addition, it would outsource the cost of purchasing the discrete GPU to the user (And therefore wouldn\\'t damage the high profit margins that Apple seems to be clinging on to in recent times).\\n\\nI\\'m speaking from an Apple fanboy perspective as well.',\n",
