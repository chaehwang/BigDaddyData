A few years ago, Facebook realized that people were posting fewer and fewer status updates and more and more photos... then it became fewer photos (with the accompanying rise of Instagram, which launched in February 2010 and which Facebook bought in April 2012) and more links and videos, i.e. content from other websites. Then Facebook generally began to prioritize video posts, as video posts also proliferated, and that became a hand-in-hand cycle. Then, wanting to take on YouTube in terms of view-counts, Facebook made it so that Facebook-posted videos (i.e. not videos embedded from YouTube) would autoplay, albeit on mute, as you you scrolled down through your Newsfeed. If you want to pause the autoplaying muted video, you could click the video. However, as of today, December 9, 2015, when you click the video to pause it, it instead just opens as a big wide pop-up, and the audio turns on, and the whole background becomes dark gray.  And if that's not enough, the lower half of the screen is a horizontal row of the 'Suggest Videos,' which then autoplay, which is something YouTube has been for a year or so by default (on desktop and laptop computers anyway) with 'Related Videos.' **(TL;DR-)** So, when you wanted to just pause the video, perhaps because you didn't want to to watch any of it at all, Facebook now plays that videos for you, AND it's the first in an infinite playlist!

Tim Cook is being willfully ignorant. This is nothing to do with machines to take tests on.  Classrooms need reliable devices that work.  When you have 30 kids in a room and you're trying to get something accomplished in a 55 minute class period you don't have time to troubleshoot that Mac asking for a password to install updates from the App store, or that iPad that had the icons shuffled/hidden by the last person who used it, or that Windows computer running OneNote that lags horribly when more than 3-4 people try to collaborate on a document at the same time. 5 minutes here helping Suzy fix a problem and 3 minutes there helping Ned and suddenly you've wasted your entire class time and gotten nothing accomplished.

Teachers LOVE chromebooks and Google Apps because they are reliable, they are easy, the collaboration works really well and they let them focus on teaching instead of troubleshooting.

81,"> IPads are worthless gimmicks in the classroom.

Nothing but the truth. In high school when we had to work on a project or something that required internet access, we would all hope and pray that the teacher didn't get stuck with the iPad cart because the other laptop carts were reserved. Often times we would just take our phones out and do the project on them instead of using the iPads. We got a few Chromebook carts during my last year and they quickly became the go-to classroom tech. They came in at like 1/3 of the cost of an iPad cart too. Tablets are just too big to type on and really only good for watching videos, which you really shouldn't be doing in school anyways.

Maybe if Apple wants part of the school market they should offer useful tech at reasonable prices, because right now they literally have neither.

In our K-8, shared environment, I'm not even sure I'd agree with that first part.

Even if you offered us a chance to replace Chromebooks with ipads (and made it so there were no additional fees for MDM, annual licenses, etc)  we'd still pick Chromebooks.  iPads are fine for many things. K-8 edu in a shared environment is not one of them.  

If you gave them to us for FREE we'd probably find some niche/specialized use for them.  Maybe make them kid-friendly cameras or some such.  But I'd be willing to get the Chromebooks would still be the tool of choice for all else for about 98% of staff (including I.T.!)

I've also owned two iPads, a 13"" MacBook Air, a 15"" Retina MacBook Pro, two iPhones, a box full of Android phones (including my current daily driver, a Nexus 5X, which I'm quite happy with after selling my iPhone 6.)


The point of this list is to give perspective.  Schools can buy three or four Chromebooks for the price of one MacBook Air.  


And this argument isn't really about hardware... 


Google provides a world class, complete, polished cloud solution with Google Apps for Business / Enterprise / Google Apps for Education. In a very Apple- iOS like move, the Chromebooks and their ChromeOS is purpose built to marry custom hardware to a closed, custom OS that provides a lightning fast, well designed solution for users who wish to use Google Apps.  


I have a friend whose wife is a teacher.  She recently asked for help with some spreadsheet functions.  I was stunned to discover to degree to which her ENTIRE school district was using Google Apps for Enterprise + Education for nearly EVERYTHING.   Administration.  Faculty.  Students.  Document storage.  Tests.  It was fast, it was seamless, it was very easily and powerfully administered by a fraction of the staff needed for a comparable Windows Enterprise solution, and - more topical to this thread reply, Apple OFFERS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE IT. 


Tim Cook, I'm really sorry cash-strapped public school systems aren't interested in your feature-incomplete, iCloud crippled, rudimentary ""iWork"" apps or $650 phones, $750 iPad ""Pro's"", or $1400 MacBook Air's that are better suited for playing Flappy Bird on the toilet and surfing Instagram.


When you build your empire on the lifestyle marketing of designer overpriced hardware and completely neglect or fail to build the cloud infrastructure and enterprise quality applications necessary to attract the interest of big business or academia, you will fail to attract the interest of big business or academia.

Most of it is nice.  When I start explicitly specifying *exactly* what I want to look for, same as I did back in the day, and it still decides I'm a moron - and maybe I am - I'll happily take suggestions for writing better searches in this Brave New World - it's *not* okay.

I write extremely specialized technical searches with as much written-in specificity as I can manage, and I get shit about *lamps*?

Naw, lil' porchmonkey, that ain't okay.  (It's okay, I'm taking *that* back!)

Let's take a wild guess as to the pretty fucking huge changes I've seen happen between 2005 and 2015 - it's a sea change that's largely reduced functionality.

Hell, there's stuff you can't even search for now!  I know, watched a lot of search results just disappear into the blue.

You can believe what you want, ad hominem, whatever - but search for ""X"" and ""Y"" isn't accurate, linear, and provides lots of highlighted synonyms.

424,"I hope you all see this so that the same thing doesn't happen to you like it did to me.


Last night I downloaded iOS 9.2 onto my 6S. Everything went fine, no problems at all. I work a night shift, so at 7pm I put it to sleep, pocket it, and don't check it until my break at 1:30am. My phone has died. Skeptical, I plug it into my charger. After an hour it has only charged 40%. I can feel the phone heating up. I set up low-power mode and dive into the settings.


I made sure no apps were being refreshed in the background. I quit out of everything. Sure enough, it still drained, and I stopped it from dying by switching to Airplane Mode at 15%. Still confused, I resolved to figure it out after work.


I get in my car, and open the Music app after plugging into my stereo. Lo and behold, I see a bar at the top with some text saying, ""**Downloading 771 Songs**"". Holy shit. I had already downloaded my music via the ""make available offline"" feature, but installing iOS 9.2 must have changed that.



I go home, plug in, and get out of airplane mode and onto wi-fi. I get a text from my provider that **75% of the 12GB shared data plan for the month has been used**. Fuck. I don't connect to my work's wi-fi, so my phone tried to download all those songs over LTE. 



TL;DR: iOS 9.2 makes you re-download all your supposedly ""offline"" songs, and it will drain your battery and data if not caught. ",Apple,1449703094.0,100,100 :: iOS 9.2 and Apple Music: A Cautionary Tale,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3w53wm/ios_92_and_apple_music_a_cautionary_tale/

In fact, it's fairly misleading to even say someone ""accepts"" or ""doesn't accept"" Apple Pay.

Walmart refusing to adopt the payment standard is almost tantamount to refusing to accept credit cards to begin with.

697,I don't like the way they designed the remote.  It's very easy to pick it up the wrong way and also very easy to accidentally slide a movie forward or backward with the track pad.

699,"This is my big issue. Plus, the remote is so sensitive, that if you just pick it up to move it, you are likely to trigger the HDMI CEC which turns on the ATV and my TV. I love that functionality, but it should only be triggered by pressing a button, not touching the pad. These two issues together mean that the new ATV is very low on the WAF (wife acceptance factor).

707,"I'm pretty happy with it. The interface is intuitive, attractive and very responsive. Way better than anything else out there. 

The remote took some getting used - I didn't care much for it at first. The design of it makes the orientation kind of ambiguous, and swiping doesn't really lend itself to accuracy. But now, anytime I go back to using my 3rd gen Apple TV I'm very aware of just how many freaking button presses are required to do anything. I love the simplicity of the new remote, and being able to control the volume and power on my TV from it is a very welcome addition.

A few of the video streaming service apps(YouTube, Netflix and Hulu in particular) are inferior to their ATV 2+3 cousins, but for the most part, apps and games have been pretty polished great. 

I haven't had a chance to update to 9.1 yet, so I can't speak for the current state of tvOS, but there have been some annoying bugs. A particularly annoying bug is one that causes the device to turn the TV back on after the device has been put to sleep.

729,"I'm liking it. Personally, I don't think it's worth the upgrade if you already have an Apple TV/FireTV, Roku, etc.

Pros:

* interface design and controller are different but feel right at home if you're already an Apple TV user
* Siri works extremely well but missing integration with all apps. I treat this as a positive since it'd be silly to assume we won't see fuller integration over time
* AirPlay seems to work more smoothly and more quickly. The time it took for the initial stream to start on my Apple TV 3 is longer.
* Integrated volume control and CEC control of my television On/Off is a welcome change--though, I wish I didn't have to switch remotes to switch inputs back-and-forth from antenna television

Cons:

* I see sub-60fps animations all the time, even after the update. Swiping back and forth over pre-loaded images of media, even in Apple's apps, will cause stuttering
* Picking up a remote indelicately may result in skipping forward or backward in time--easily remedied by hitting the ""Menu"" button to go back

* Apple Music uses your iTunes store account, not one of your family sharing accounts.

740,"Hey Everyone, 

I bought the iPhone Smart Battery Case yesterday and I got to say I am disappointed. It compelled me to put a comparison chart together going over the key features with it's main competitors. ( 

Some Pro's and Con's 

##[Apple Smart Battery Case]( 

#Pros

**Lightening Charging Cable**- Unlike most other battery cases Apple has built in the lightning charger into their case so you don’t need any extra plugs. 

**Material and Feel**- Apple used the same silicon material for their primary phone cases and it hits home again. Great look and feel in the hands. 

Smart Functionality- With their native OS integration and smart functionality it enhances the batteries ability to quickly become part of your phone experience. 

#Cons

**Battery Power**- At only 1870mah it provides one of the lowest additional power than any other battery case on the market.  

**Earphone compatibility**- Surprisingly most earphone plugs don’t fit in the outlet including Apple’s own Beats earphones. 

**Odd shape**- It’s been called the “Camel” case but very unlike Apple they weird hump on the back of the case doesn’t match Apple usual sleek designs. 

Apple will probably sell a lot of these cases but it’s not what we have come to expect from a design first company. Coupled with it’s above average price and lack of earphone compatibility we give the new Smart Battery Case the Silver award primarily because of it’s seamless integration with the iPhone operating system.  



##[mybumper battery case]( 


#Pros 

**Detachable battery**- mybumper is designed to let you easily snap on and off the battery pack and other accessories based on what type of day you have. A big benefit for those that like to keep the phone as close to it’s naked state. 

**Price**- At one of the lowest price points, it’s power capacity is better than Apple’s and it’s hard to deny a 50% less price tag. 

**Protection**- It’s hard plastic outer layer coupled with its shock absorbing rubber inner layer provides a 110% guarantee on protecting your phone. 

#Cons

**Micro USB charging**- Like the mophie and unlike Apple it requires an additional Micro USB cable to charge the case. 

**Newness to the Market**- mybumper was only recently released so they are a rookie in this growing market. 

**Battery Power Button**- Like almost all other battery cases on the market mybumper requires you to double tap the power button on the back to initiate the charge. 

Not everyone wants to have a case that only provides extra juice and this is where the mybumper product shines. It’s ability to detach the battery based on the need or lack of need for more juice coupled with it’s most affordable price point makes mybumper the surprising gold winner. 


##[Mophie](

#Pros

**Sleek Design**- Mophie never disappoints with their aesthetic designs and variety of color options.

**Ton of options**- If you need a lot of extra juice or want a slimmer, less battery option Mophie has you covered with multiple different products under their umbrella. 

**Experience in the market**- Mophie is one of the more well known battery case brands and have tons of satisfied customers. 

#Cons

**Bulkiness**- People love the iphone for it’s shape and even Mophie’s slimmest option is pretty bulky and a lot thicker than other competitors on the market. 

**Price**- Although there are many product options their cornerstone products are between $80-$120 which is on the high side from a price perspective. 

**Micro USB charging**- Unlike Apple you can’t use the lightning cable and must use a separate Micro USB to charge your battery case. 

Although Mophie has trail blazed the battery case market it’s bulky cases, high price tags and singular functionality unfortunately gets them the bronze.

743,"Great review and write up, really clearly outlines the major pros and cons. 

I think the interesting thing is the real trade off between the mophie and the apple case is whether the extra battery life is worth being able to charge via lighting.

757,"> Industry executives say Apple has spent much of 2015 pushing for a “skinny” bundle of TV channels — limited to perhaps a dozen core networks — delivered over the Web, which would retail for no more than $30.

does anyone want this though? all those garbage sitcoms, reality shows, talk shows, game shows, soap operas etc with interminable commercials?

that bird has flown imo; commercial-free on-demand a la carte TV is is what Netflix, Amazon et al are delivering and people can't get enough of it",Apple,1449770314.0,3,14 :: Why Apple Walked Away From TV (For Now),https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3w6o2h/why_apple_walked_away_from_tv_for_now/cxubhne
758,"I think there should be an alternative to the on-demand with some type of editorial programming. For some people, they get decision paralysis when they are presented with the overwhelming choices that Netflix and Amazon have.

When I sit down to eat lunch and watch TV, I just turn on ESPN or HGTV cause I know whatever's on will mildly entertain me. Whereas if I had to choose something on Netflix, I'd probably be looking for like 15 minutes because I'm choosing it. I know it's a weird distinction, but haven't you ever spent most of the time you blocked to watch Netflix just deciding what to watch?

What I'd like is a streaming service (ideally without commercials) that still makes those programming choices for me so I can passively watch something. Like Beats Music does.",Apple,1449772861.0,2,14 :: Why Apple Walked Away From TV (For Now),https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3w6o2h/why_apple_walked_away_from_tv_for_now/cxudb7c
759,"Yes! I was thinking the same thing earlier. I was on vacation recently and forced into the regular TV game, and I watched like 4 random movies and loved it. A lot wasn't in English so it really cut down my choices and I was more care free about it. Sometimes more choices isn't necessarily good. imo Netflix can do this easily, but it will take time to nail. You could probably pretty easily imitate the experience of channel surfing. Perhaps even showing users the episode or movie already in progress, and then giving an option to start from the beginning (or just keep going) if they get hooked. If not just keep going. This flipping back and forth seamlessly might be hard since Netflix has to load but I'm sure there's a way to do it.

Air Display 3 is something to keep an eye on. Until recently, they offered pressure sensitive support for Windows computers, but they recently seemed to have bungled it up. Their last update was in September and they may fix the problems sometime soon.

To rip blu rays use can use Make MKV to get a lossless file from disc. Then run it through your transcoding software of choice to bring the file size down. Handbrake is an excellent way to go with this (there is an OS X version)

You can choose any format or container you want for your movies. Go with mp4 container and choose h.264 encoding for compatibility with iTunes and the Apple TV. Handbrake should have a preset for Apple TV compatible output that can be customized to your needs. 

You should be able to store all your files on your Time Capsule (you may have to enable network drive shares). An external drive would work as well.

957,"I'm trying to decide between these two monitors. I have a current model 15 rMBP with AMD GPU and 90% of the time I am at my office. I really appreciate screen real estate as I don't like having windows blocking other windows. 

I thought I was settled on two Dell P2715Q displays but I was looking around and noticed that WQHD 34"" displays are getting popular and there are good options now. If I went with the Dell WQHD 34"" U3415W

Both have a refresh rate of 60hz.

How do I decide between the two? My plan was two buy 2 Dell P2715Q monitors running at HiDPi 1440 (1080 HiDPi loses too much screen real estate and 1440 HiDPi would look great). If I do go with the WQHD display, if I like the first one, I'll definitely buy a second.

I don't play any games and do very basic photo editing (basically I upload from my Nikon DSLR and import to a Lightroom library after a preset to optimize colors and white balance). I use my computer mainly to read text, write, use Google Chrome (which includes an occasional Youtube video), code and read PDFs. The idea of being able to have a full sized window open for writing text and next to it a PDF without having to minimize anything, would be great!

I was wondering how the sharpness of text on the WQHD display will be compared to a 4k monitor (at 1440 HiDPi)? Right now I have 2 27"" Apple displays... Is it right to assume the WQHD display will display text similar to the Apple display? I can see a huge difference in text sharpness between my retina MBP and my Apple displays (almost to the point where I don't use my Apple external displays anymore). 

Also, which monitor is more taxing on my GPU? The 4k display or the WQHD display? I will get very annoyed if my computer starts to lag/get jittery when having many windows open.

1. i like the ultra wide format over a regular screen.

2. Scaling isn't perfect on a 4K or 5k. 1440p doesn't have that problem. I think this is the big reason why people are still sticking with 1440. OS X has the best support, Windows and Linux usually have enough problems and inconsistencies to make using really high dpi monitors a pain.

983,"I have a couple of bugs ever since I updated to El Capitan.

Late 2012 Imac, 27 inches.

1) My Finder is sort of messed up. When switching tabs, it will occasionally expend vertically to take up the entire height of the screen. Also, my preview pane is kind of glitched, with elements being off center and sometimes half hidden.

[Imgur](
[Imgur](

For some reason though, the Finder and its preview pane are perfectly fine when I'm opening or saving files from an application, such as Openoffice or Affinity Designer, or whatever. Only the regular Finder by itself has that issue.

2) You know how you can use keyboard shortcuts to put your display or hard drive to sleep? I used to sleep my display all the time using cmd+shift+eject.

Now, if I do one of these shortcuts, the power button's behavior changes. Instead of doing its normal thing depending on how long you press it, it will only immitate the behavior of the last ""sleep"" keyboard shortcut I used, accompanied by a ""bloop"" sound.

It will keep working wrong until I restart the computer.

I've done all sort of thing trying to fix it. I've reset SMC and PRAM, went through my libraries to get rid of old files I didn't didn't anymore, hoping one of them was the culprit. I've even reinstalled El Capitan (not a clean install) and downloaded the update 2 days ago.

I am due for an upgrade and I am thinking one of the 2016 Mac laptops. I am currently running a early 2011 MBP and it does most of the tasks I ask of it but I'm ready for a change. 

My question is are all the current line of Macs more powerful then what I currently have? I might consider not getting a MBP and instead go with the MacBook or the MBA if they added retina. 

I do use Final Cut and I know it works best on a MBP but unless the design of the 2016 changes quite a bit I would prefer something thinner and lighter.

986,"From the reviews I've seen, if you use Final Cut Pro, it's recommended to stay with the MBP line, especially if you edit any 4K video. See review: 

**Quick Comparisons**

* The 15"" MBP 2011 model out performs the new Macbook 2015 model. 
* If you go to the 2014 15"" rMBP then there's a good performance bump  (sorry couldn't find the 2015 rMBP).
* But if you go to 13"" rMBP then it's kind of a toss up since the 2011 model has more cores. 

It all depends on how you use your computer (heavy FCP editing or occasional light FCP editing?) and how much are you willing to spend to upgrade. Keep in mind the new Apple laptops can't be upgraded later, so you have to buy all the ram and hdd space upfront. Also the base 15"" rMBP does not come with a dGPU, so it's another ~$500 if you want that. If it's light FCP editing, I think you could comfortably use a 13"" MBP.

One less expensive alternative, if you haven't already done so, is swapping out the internal drive to a SSD. It significantly reduces app load time and boot times, speed up hdd heavy apps, lighten the weight marginally, and bump the battery life a little.

It's incredibly light and thin, and it already has a Retina display like the Pros do. The biggest issues that I can see would be the keyboard and the port. The keyboard is often compared to typing on a touchscreen, the keys don't move much, and it's calibrated to a lighter touch. Some people, even professional writers, have actually liked it. For sure, it's nothing like the keyboards you're used to. 

And the other thing is that the only port it has is a single USB-C port. (And a headphone jack.) That's not a USB port like you know it, it's smaller, but it's a lot more capable. It's the charging port, the USB port, and it can also do video out. The thing is, you're going to need adapters to do anything. Thankfully, Apple isn't the only source. Google also released a laptop with USB-C ports, and also sells adapters that will work with the MacBook for lower than Apple prices. More adapters will be coming in the next couple years as well. This is the port that will replace USB everywhere in a few years, it's already been chosen as the successor for both USB and Micro USB, and some smartphones are already coming out with it. Next year's laptops should all have it. Though probably in addition to normal USB ports, not as a replacement. Apple is jumping the gun, as usual, but I really can't complain when the laptop is this small. You have to see it to believe it.

Edit: never mind, I looked up benchmarks for MacBook vs MBP 2011, they're roughly equivalent in performance. The graphics are stronger to match the Retina display, and if you haven't upgraded to an SSD... Well, if you haven't upgraded to an SSD, this will be a blazingly, blazingly fast computer for you. That does more than a CPU increase any day, Intel processors have been fast enough to handle things for a long while, even underpowered ones like these. But storage has been a bottleneck for years.

Me: My mail carrier often does not deliver my packages but she will leave a notice that it was attempted when she really did not attempt.

I pay for Amazon prime because of the 2 day shipping and this is very frustrating. I have contacted my post office, I just wonder if there is something Amazon can do. Amazon has a HUGE partnership with the post office and should be able to lean on them to get things done! Or just ship with UPS or something.

Amazon: Hello, my name is Mrinal. I will be happy to help you today.

I am really sorry for the inconvenience caused to you *mysoulishome*.Could you please confirm me your order id?


Me: My post office just called me back and said the carrier did not bring it today because she did not have room in her vehicle...

I find that UPS is a far better carrier than the postal service. I wish that more packages were delivered with UPS and not USPS. Whenever something comes USPS I get disappointed because they may not deliver it...they might just leave a notice in my mailbox and not try to bring it to me. My UPS driver is very dependable.

Amazon: You are right *mysoulishome*. We are also facing the same problem from the USPS And we are receiving too many complaints about it.This is really a point of thinking for Amazon to work on the carrier issue and fix the problem.

Amazon is working on it for its customer satisfaction and your feedback is precious to us.I can understand your disappointment for this.

Please do not worry.Could you please confirm me the order id *mysoulishome*?

Me: ORDER # numbersnumbersnumbers

I talked to the router supervisor at my post office and my carrier is bringing it this afternoon. Only because I called. Sometimes they never deliver it at all, they just leave a notice and never try again unless I call...

My UPS guy is fantastic, if he could bring all of my packages I would be happy. I even have his cell phone number.

Amazon: Thank you for your order id *mysoulishome*.

Please do not worry.i am checking this for you.

Could you please allow me couple of minutes while I am looking this for you?

Me: Sure

Amazon: Thank you *mysoulishome*.

Me: As I said, my carrier is indeed delivering it this afternoon because I called...but I am still frustrated

The frustration is the reason for my contact.

Amazon: I can understand you feelings *mysoulishome* .This is also disappointing for us that we are not meeting our customers need.

Thank you for your patience *mysoulishome*.

Please do not worry,You will receive your package tomorrow.I can understand that this assurance is not helpful for you.I am sending your feedback to our Amazon team.They will surely take an action on it.I can provide you 10% discount on this to compensate this issue as an one time exception for you.Should it be helpful for you?

Me: I talked to the post office and they are bringing it today...as I said before...

But I am still frustrated with the service I get when Amazon packages come through the USPS so I wanted to give my complaints.

Amazon: Yes sure *mysoulishome*.I am forwarding your complaints to The Amazon team.And I am also providing you 10% discount on this.

Me: A discount would be appreciated but mostly I just hope this service improves...or Amazon could only ship with UPS or Fedex, or DHL, and not the post office. The post office is much less dependable than all of those.

Amazon: You are absolutely right *mysoulishome*.

Please do not worry.We will fix this problem as soon as possible.
I have issued 10% discount on this which you will receive in next 2-3 business days.

Me: OK

My biggest issue is with Amazon using FedEx in my area now. FedEx will rarely leave a package at my door. I've complained to Amazon CS so many times and every single time they do nothing. I've called FedEx, they don't know why because there's no signature required, ever. There's a camera in plain view, and I live in an area where theft doesn't happen. Why the hell can't they just leave it! Even when there's already UPS packages sitting in front of my door the driver still takes it back to his truck. COME ON! No one knows why!

I surmise that inventory levels, employee labor, shipping capacity, and lead times are a few of many factors that are impacted as the general public migrates to shopping online more often.  All of this is compounded exponentially as Christmas gets closer.  I expect items purchased via Amazon sub-vendors are more likely to be delivered late as opposed to stuff that Amazon has in stock.  Amazon has limited visibility of how much inventory sub-vendors are carrying.

I was offered a replacement or a refund, to which I said that would choose a replacement if they could assure me that my item would arrive in good condition.

Another contact with support and they're just as apologetic, as well as offering me yet another replacement, but this time they added in that this one could end up the same way.

1202,"First of all, the dealership is going to tell you whatever they have to in order to sell you the car *they want you to buy*. 

That being said Camrys and Corollas are good cars for the average person, since they get good gas mileage for the things that most drivers do. However, as an Uber driver you will not being driving the way normal drivers do. You will be driving short distances quite often, stopping and starting frequently, and sitting with the car on waiting for unknown lengths of time.

Let's look at some gas mileage figures.

Car | Camry | Corolla | Prius V | Prius C
-----|---------|----------|---------|---------
**Highway MPG** | 35 | 42 | 40 | 46
**City MPG** | 25 | 30 | 44 | 53

Look at the huge leap in city mileage when you switch to the hybrids. This is because starting from a stop is extremely inefficient with a traditional gas engine/transmission setup. Also all the energy from braking is wasted.

With a hybrid system some of the braking energy is used to charge the battery. Then the electric motor can get the car moving from a stop much more efficiently than the gas motor. The gas motor will kick in when it is most efficient to do so. Also with a gas car you'll waste a lot of gas idling while waiting for passengers, whereas a hybrid does not idle at all.

If your primary use for this car will be Uber, then a hybrid is the best way to go.

Don't neglect the insurance issue though. Look at cars all you want for the time being but don't buy anything until you're sure there is an insurance company in your area that will cover rideshare partners.

The problem for Lyft is that many riders have already switched over to uber and probably won't look back. So it's probably too late to help Lyft's rider numbers. 

And Lyft needs needs the riders *desperately* in order to raise that additional 500m funding they seek. It seems like they are now heading along the path that Sidecar took.  Lyft has already dropped out of some markets/cities.

1233,"Driving for LYFT in L.A. is a losing proposition now and it's only recently I discovered why. To be able to cut rates lower, Lyft needs enough drivers to cover the number of drivers who stop driving because of the cuts, so in the last two months there has been carpet bombing marketing on Craigslist and social media to get new drivers. As soon as saturation point was reached they cut the rates. To see this for yourself, go into the app in rider mode at any time of day or night and see how many cars are on the road, the number is actually unbelievable. With all that said, I'm really not sure what the end game is for Lyft: They recruit hundreds of new drivers on a weekly basis, which costs them admin and mentor fees. Those drivers then hit the road, realize there is no money to be made and either quit or move to Uber. The process is then repeated over and over again. Using saturation as a business strategy is fine in theory, but can only work if the drivers that have been signed up actually make some money. You will also see this is why the power bonus has been changed, it will now be impossible for anyone to meet the criteria in L.A. Ultimately, Lyft don't care how many cars are on the road, or who does or does not make money, and therein lies the problem. The extra business created by rate cuts is not passed on to the drivers because of the sheer number of extra drivers that have been signed up. It's a vicious circle that has no logical endgame.",Lyft,1449770895.0,2,7 :: Is it me or is it super slow in LA,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/3w52g3/is_it_me_or_is_it_super_slow_in_la/cxubwl4

1235,"Normally Uber, Lyft both takes 20%, drivers take 80%.  Things are changing.  Recently, lots of uber drivers complaining as time flies, more and more cities are taking away 25% of the cut or after a certain date for new drivers.  They're conditioning new uber drivers to ""Better get use to it, it's going to become the norm."" Testing the waters, and see how many suckers fall for the bait.  Many will, the ones desperate for a job & don't mind adding tonss of mileage on their personal cars, no doubt.  Maybe within a few years, Uber will gradually increase the cut so they takes 30-40-50%, until fully automated self driving uber cars take over in a decade, two, or three in the near future.  Cause then, humans aren't needed and become obsolete.  Travis sounded very excited with a evil capitalistic cold smile, about his end-game future goals for the company, about getting rid of human drivers and the ""dude in the car"", replacing them with self driving cars cause it means more profit and money, in a interview that you can watch online.  That is well known.  Signs of Capitalism at it's finest, greed takes over, than it looks like you have no soul and don't care about providing jobs by getting rid of humans and replacing them by cars that run & profit themselves.  Sadly.  And the way it was all done in a ill manner, and how drivers & independent contractor drivers are badly treated like slaves, underpaid, aren't appreciated, no benefits or barely any, not enough work, too saturated with other drivers, ratings are a joke, passengers trying to fit 5 people when only 4 seats are available then get pissed, and how there's NO number to call these tech companies, only by email which is a hit & miss don't always get a response back, the list of complaints & bad things go on & on.

&nbsp;

Think Lyft will do the same to it's drivers eventually and take 25% ? Or stay 20% and it gives newbie Lyft drivers a bigger incentive to drive for Lyft cause the company takes less of the cut.  If they stay 20%, they can REALLY win over a LOT of new drivers cause they make more.

1252,">1. What happens if I accidentally missed a pax notification?

You'll see a notification on your screen that says ""You missed a request!"" and it will tell you to go offline if you are unavailable to take rides.  After you miss 3 in a row (I think) it automatically signs you off.  Your acceptance rate will be affected and if it stays consistently low you'll start getting warnings from Lyft...but I'm talking LOW. If you miss one here or there, no big deal. Some guarantees require you keep your acceptance rate above 90%.

>2. How long do I have to accept a notification?

12 seconds.

>3. How long after I accept a notification do I have to arrive to the pax location?

When you get a request, the app gives you an arrival estimate. They can be 1 minute for a request a block ahead of you or up 20 or more minutes for someone much much farther away. Depending on your market you'll have to decide if those long pick up times are worth it for you. The initial time estimates seem to be calculated by ""as the crow flies"", but once you accept the ride the actual navigation time can be much different from the initial time estimate.  

I got an email from Lyft months and months ago saying my arrival times had been longer than the estimates.  But, as I always just drive straight to the pick up address, I just ignored it and carried on with how I had always done it.  Around that time I remembered a ride where the passenger was on the opposite side of a building than where his pin dropped. I had already hit ""Arrived"" since I was parked next to the pin, but I ended up having to drive several blocks just to get to the opposite side of the building.  The guy complained to me about it and I expect he complained to Lyft. I don't know if that was why I got the email (or even if he complained to Lyft) but my conscience was clear so I didn't worry about it.
  
>4. How can I see a detailed breakdown on how much I've made on a trip (mileage + time + tips, etc.)? I can only see the summary of how much I made in the trips.

It comes in your daily summary. It will be emailed to you. They are rather anemic with information unfortunately. Pick up times, names, maps...none of that is included.  Uber breaks down trip information much better.

>5. Good talking points with pax?

Just do what comes natural. Eventually you will find you have pretty much the same conversation many, many times a week.  Some people are cool though. Ask questions.

>6. Any other suggestions for newbies?

Just do your thing bro.",Lyft,1449710106.0,4,1 :: New Lyft Driver w/ Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/3w5cjb/new_lyft_driver_w_questions/cxtk1y1
1253,"further detail about 3: the Lyft app will estimate how long it should take you to get there, so try to be at least that fast. If you are held up in bad traffic, text or call (many pax prefer texts, more on that in a second), to let them know. Pax can cancel at any point before you arrive, so don't get too discouraged if they flake on you. (if they cancel you don't get paid)

Save the Lyft phone number (it's a generic one owned by Lyft) into your contacts so you can text and call from outside the app if you need to. Also remember that as soon as you drop off a pax that number basically ""dies"" so if they leave something in your car after you've confirmed the drop off, you can't use it to message them about it.

Talking points? let them do the work besides a brief ""how are you doing"". If a pax is feeling chatty they'll dictate where it goes. If they start onto something dodgy (i.e. politics, religion) just respond with mild acknowledgment even if they say something dumb as hell. Also don't allow yourself to get distracted and miss a turn.

Also, don't hit ""drop off"" until they are actually out of the car. If you get rear ended or have some other incident with them still there you want Lyft to cover your ass.

Remember that you are allowed to accept tips in cash as well as in the app. Don't turn down free money.",Lyft,1449784446.0,1,1 :: New Lyft Driver w/ Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/3w5cjb/new_lyft_driver_w_questions/cxull8x

2. I don't know, about 3 minutes or so, it should have a countdown
3. I don't know, I don't think there is a limit, the pax gets a ETA notification when you accept, so around that. given the gripes along the lines of 'this dick was 30 minutes away, fuck that', it varies based on distance.

1280,"Yes. Talk to the host. There may be specific reasons why there is a person limit, so the host needs an opportunity to explain those limitations to you. 

The listing's number of guests is how many can be there happily before problems start to arise. It can be the sewer system, show access, sleeping limits, linen limits, etc. 

Don't be shocked if a host still charges you more after explaining how the quality will be compromised with so many people. It simply has more wear and tear and more risk to have that many people simultaneously. So, in the end, you all may be more comfortable at a place designated for 8 people and pay only a little more.

1291,"Superhost here - Whatever you do, BE HONEST and don't try to get clever/sneaky on your hosts. You need to clear this with the host BEFORE you book/arrive. Some hosts of smaller places might be fine if you pay a small surcharge per extra guest. 

If someone booked a spot that states it sleeps 4 with me and DOESNT warn me about the extra people, and then showed up with 8 people (or I found out that 8 were staying there mid-stay), you would have your trip cancelled on the spot and reported to airbnb. If I found out when you checked in, I wouldn't hand you the keys in the first place. If I found out mid-stay, you would come back to the property to find the place locked and all your shit on the porch.

 Hosts list the maximum occupancy for a reason. There are laws where I live about how many people can stay in a residence before the crowding becomes a safety issue. Neighbors who wouldn't mind a group of 4 staying in a cottage end up annoyed when a large group is cramming itself into the same cozy spot. Finally, some hosts who say max guests 4 are specifically trying to AVOID large groups and the commotion/noise/trash that parties create.

Hosts price per person based on the wear and tear to the unit, and based on a reasonable price to pay per party member. if you think $40/person isn't frugal enough for you (and that's a fucking steal and you should just pay it, frankly), imagine getting to pay last-minute hotel rates for 8 folks after losing the processing fees (which airbnb doesn't refund).

I booked back in August but now that it is winter I started to look into it to begin planning things in and around the condo (which was shown right in the village). When I couldn't find the condo I got suspicious. I asked for the address and they gave it to me. Turns out, it is over 2 miles from the village and across a highway. They admitted it is not within walking distance to the lifts or towns. They claim that it is okay because it is on the mountain shuttle. This completely changes the dynamic of the trip (cant go back to the condo for lunch, can't walk to and from dinner, bars, entertainment etc). Major bummer.

1298,"airbnb should have provided you with the address directly (not by asking the hosts, but by an automated message from airbnb releasing that information.) Are you saying that the system didn't provide you with the address, or that the host contacted you separately and provided you with a different address?

Just to clarify, i'm not talking about the approximate location shown on the map when you inquire/are shopping around, but the exact physical address of the property you booked through airbnb that you get AFTER booking. There shouldn't be an opportunity for the host to block your access to that address, and that is the address they held out as being available/convenient (and the one you are entitled to expect to use). 

Is the host saying that location is not available for your stay, that the location never existed in the first place, or that the location is as Airbnb shows it, but you are finding out that the location is not actually close to the lifts? I ask because if there was never a property in the location airbnb was told there was, airbnb should DEACTIVATE that listing entirely as fraudulent and not existing. 

They are both shitty, but bad hosts do two different things here: they have one attractive listing (that actually exists) and some less attractive homes, and they try to funnel people to the other accommodations thru the attractive one (which does exist and which does get booked but chances are you'll be offered one of the crappier spots) - the host always says some bullshit like ""the system messed up and double booked that spot, can you stay in [crappier offsite accommodations]? That is shitty host tactic #1.

Shitty host tactic #2 is that the nice apartment near the stuff doesn't exist at all, and the space being offered at all times is the crappier offsite one. In that case, the host is committing a ""bigger"" fraud against airbnb (because as a host, you provide the exact address of the spot you are offering to airbnb, which generates the pin location shown on maps to guests, and which is released to guests when they complete a booking).

A month ago I got my first Fitbit, a secondhand flex.

Since day one I loved it with my whole heart. The whole steps counting idea is awesome and design wise it looks fine by my standard.



Just a few weeks ago a friend gave me his charge, he had it laying around still in the box, unused.

However when I booted it up, the screen was glitching and I wasn't able to even set it up properly.

I immediatly contacted the friend and asked if he had the receipt still. But too bad, he didn't.



I then proceeded to contact Fitbit and asked if they could help me and yes they could! 

However, by accident they send me the flex, probably because it's the only one connected to my Fitbit.

After mailing some more, they immediatly wanted to help me get the right one!

I just bought a Fitbit Surge several days ago and I'm really enjoying it. I ride a motorbike everyday and I was aware of the issue with it (counting a lot of steps and floors). However, I have been loging this ridings as motorbike activities thanks to the app DriveBit.

The problem is that I've realized that in the activity calendar those days are marked as if I'd made exercise, which makes me haeder to read the calendar to track my actual activities.

Do you know if there is a way to mark these motorbike activities as not real exercise? Am I doing something wrong?

I like my Fitbit, but am not blown away by it. I don't really care about steps. I do like knowing about how many calories I have burned. The food log is meh compared to MyFitnessPal.

Here's what would get my HR racing. A customizable Coach. And I'd pay for it.

What would I want my **FitBit Coach** to do? 

Things like this:

* Vibrate/alert my phone every time my exercise HR drops below a certain point during exercise or goes over a certain point. This would help me pace myself. Same when I have reached a certain distance. 

* Vibrate/alert me when I am probably behind in my water drinking for the day

* Vibrate/alert me when I've have burned enough calories and am back in my ""zone"" and can eat if I wish. 

* Vibrate/alert me when it's time for me to get in bed. It knows when my alarm is set. It knows how long I take to get to sleep. It can tell me when to get into bed. 

* Vibrate/alert when I'm behind on my calorie burn (or steps or whatever) for the day. 

* Vibrate/alert when I've been stationary for too long.

* Vibrate/alert when I am munching too much. If I wear it on the hand I eat with and it sees that I am raising my hand to my mouth over and over and over, I am probably munching. You have a different rhythmn when you're watching TV and munching on chips VS when you're eating a regular meal 

* A reminder to exercise or meditate or do Yoga

* I'm sure it could do a ton of things like this. What other ideas do you have?

If it's in general, you might want to try asking on /r/android too. I think people mostly use this sub to find new friends, so I'm not sure if you'll get much help here, sorry. I'm not familiar with your phone model, but it could be something specific to your phone/version of android(I know Marshmallow has had some problems with snapchat and lag for example) and the android sub will probably have heard of it if so.

I have heard that using third party apps can get you banned from snapchat, but as far as I know, it shouldn't be affecting anything otherwise.

1536,"Good Morning Reddit, how are you all today?

So I am here on reddit to meet new people and have some fun conversations, meeting people of the world is good fun and I enjoy seeing what kinds of people there are out there in the world. So a bit about me, I am a 21 year old guy who was born in the Uk but I now live in Australia, moved about 4 years ago. I am a sci fi fan and I am a gamer, mainly on PC, I work in retail so nothing overly fancy but it is good fun. I am pretty random and crazy at times, very easy going and I try to help people as much as I can,. 

So if I sound like the kinda person you want to get to know, then send me a fun question to start that chat, it can be absolutely anything. I really don't mind, I'll probably answer it. 

So if you want to talk to me, PM me your username or comment it down below, alternatively you can add me at Optimashprime.

Asana is super useful! Love their developers! I have heard from some people though that Asana can be limited to scheduling, rather than actually processing tasks. Still love it!

Evernote also just came out with a sort of template regime:  

If you are thinking of trying Asana read on and learn a bit more about the tools!

Most entrepreneurs will tell you that time-tracking and project management tools help them not only stay effective, but also become more successful. 

What you choose for yourself or your team really depends upon three facts: 

1. How willing you are to let go of your current software, and utilize and all-in-one tool to become more efficient. 

2. The vertical in which you and your business operates. 

3. How much flexibility and creativity you want within the program. Most, if not all successful startups deal with a need for effective process management, workflow, and organization.

With something like Transpose, you can create solutions such as templates, records, and notes. You can track orders, view inventory, enhance projects and manage content. With a simple drag-n-drop editor you get to pick from a wide selection of data fields including dates, time, files, contacts or even transcribed voice recording.

Here are some examples of what something like Transpose can do!

**IT Management:** * Smart Database for Asset Management * Help Desk Ticket and Tracker Forms * Office Relocation Records (and request online form) * Asset Management (Barcode reader in iOS and Android) * Servers, Logins/Accounts.

**Operation & Company Management:** * Web Forms for Work Orders * Voice Field for Recording Sales Meetings * Company Goals Tracker * Team Objectives Tracker * Team Vacation Planner * Meeting Agenda * Attendance and Follow Up * Meeting Action Items Tracker * Simple Project Task List.

**Sales and Marketing:** * Sales Pipeline * Customer Needs Analysis * Outbound Sales Campaign plan * Sales Activity Tracker * Share Customer Contact List * Sales Pipeline By Rep, By Size, By Stage, By Summary (view) * Customer Needs Analysis * Content Marketing: Running a Business Blog * Marketing Campaign Analysis * Marketing Quarterly Goals * Marketing Team Objectives * Sales Activity Tracker (by rep and month) * Shared Customer Contact List and Form * Sales Training Development Guide * Content Calendar/ Blogging Calendar/ Long Form Content * Event Plan and Budget * Event Registration Web Form * PR Activity Tracker * PR Event Tracker * PR Coverage Tracker * PPC Advertising Recurring Tasks Tracker * Website Change Request Tracker and Web Form

**Human Resources:** * Web Forms to Submit Resumes, Time-off Requests, Suggestion Box, Scheduling Meetings * Kanban For Applicant Tracking * Smart Database For Job Description Organizing * Calendar For Holidays, Time-off * Record Interviews * Organize Performance Reviews * Assigned To Field * Job Application Web Form * Applicant Tracker * Resume Upload and Application Web Form * New Hire Checklist * Employee Objectives and Performance Reviews * Employee Review Checklist * Employee Directory * Employee Termination Documentation * Monthly Personnel Activity Tracker * Interview Process/Workflow * Internal Job Requisition Form * Suggestion Box With Web Form

**Project Management and Product Development:** * Kanban For Project Management * Collaboration For Teams * Feature Backlog and Prioritization * Agile Software * Issues and Bug Tracker * Product User Feedback Online

**Also Employee/Team Productivity and Finance**

So please try them all! See what you like best! 

There are a number of other apps like Trello, Notable, JIRA and others but each would give you one view for your data; on kanban boards, in spreadsheets or calendars, you would have to connect all those different apps together though with something like Zapier or IFTTT to send and duplicate data between them all. Transpose offers those views as well and using the same data you already have. Check it out! would love to know what do you think..

The struggle is that the non-profit never took off. The lady had other things come up in her life and she didn't want to do the hard logistical work that was required to make it into a recognized 503(c). So the non-profit died and doesn't exist anymore.

My question is this: How do I best note this on my LinkedIn? I have the position and the description of the things I did on there already, but I don't think it's appropriate for to just put ""ultimately this failed"" on there. All of the website and social media pages have been taken down, so I can't link to anything.

Always report, even if Instagram doesn't act immediately, they keep scores. As others will probably also have their photos stolen and report them, this should eventually get that account in trouble.

If they don't pass any of that criteria, then inspect two things: distance and bio. 

Bots tend to be in the same area, so if you're seeing similar profiles within the same +-1 mile range, then they're most likely a bot.

Reading the bio can sometimes help. If they list their Instagram name, you can look it up to see if it's consistent. Check for other inconsistencies. Mismatching name, age, or location? Most likely a bot.

You may not be able to avoid them all, and you might actually miss out on legit opportunities if you assume too many profiles are bots, but at least your precious swipes won't be wasted.
