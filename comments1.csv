If they need to be mobile and ned the power there too and OSX, the MBP too.For me the iPP is a great device because two of my main activities when it comes to tech benefit greatly from the hands on approach. I also see Apple devices as a solution to get rid of lot of other hardware like cameras, drawing utensils, hardware for music like sythesizers and sequencers, just needing less physical stuff overall.With the iPhone 6s+ and iPP and maybe a MP for heavy lifting, you have everything you need for almost any creative task without having your home full of stuff.

There are many justifications for it. You have to buy a whole new TV to justify 4K.Not only that you have to buy a huge TV in order to perceive any difference. For example, on a 60"" TV you have to sit 4-6 feet away. If you sit 8-10 feet away you need a 80""+ TV to justify 4K. Heavily compressed 4K streaming is barely as good as 1080p Blu-Ray. The end user experience with 4K is not that great. This coming from a person that bought a 4K TV 3 months ago. The 4K standard is not there yet. HDR and dolby vision is still being rolled out on TVs. HDR content is so low you can consider it not available. 4K content providers require much more DRM restrictions. HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 compliance. Which means people like me that bought a 4K capable receiver 2 years ago (4K 30 Hz) now have to buy a new receiver in order to enjoy 4K content or we make do with using the TV's audio output (inferior quality).The investment needed to just watch 4K content  for me is new TV ($2000+ for 80"" since I sit 8-9 feet away)+ new receiver ($1600-$2000) + the cost of a new entertainment center to fit the gigantic new TV. A new wife that will let me put a TV that big in the living room.  Or a new house with a dedicated media room large enough to fit the new TV. I did what was sensible and feasible got a 60"" TV and on it the difference is barely noticeable from my seat. A decision I made with plans to upgrade the TV and receiver 2 years down the line when 4K has stabilized and become cheaper (OLED). I think majority have to make similar compromises in their quest for TV upgrades, which almost makes 4K a marketing tactic like 3D. All that for currently available content from Netflix, Amazon + Youtube which is low bit rate and compressed with extremely low selection. 4K Blu-Ray is just coming out and there is almost no content there.   4K doesn't improve most people's experience in any way.

I'm not going to pretend I know the financial aspect of how much it would actually *cost* Apple to include 4k capability, but it would make sense to *me* that you'd want your users to be able to share their 4k content (from their brand new shiny iPhone 6s) on as many platforms as possible. By including 4k you're only opening yourself to more customers. More people who would instantly buy the ATV simply because it has 4k, and it'd be the easiest way to share 4k content you captured with your iPhone.I'm sure it would cut the profit margin down some for Apple. But I guess the question becomes would you rather sell fewer units with a higher profit margin, or more units with a slightly lower profit margin.

654,"4K on the iPhone 6s is not enabled by default. Sharing videos, most people do on youtube, Facebook or social media, where 4K doesn't mean anything. The size and bandwidth requirements make it infeasible for sharing. Most don't even share 1080p to be honset. There is a small subset of people that require 4K to record and edit video. By making it a user selectable option it is clear Apple doesn't think 4K is mainstream enough. Even 1080p 60hz is not default on iPhones.  Especially since there is no infrastructure in social media or things most people do to make it worth while to make 4K the default. On iPhones the feature exists because Apple markets it as a device for everyone but also for discerning people that want to do more with it. Those usually tend to have a mac to edit the 4K video in creative ways. I think what would make the Apple TV instant buy for most people over 4K is a Apple Music type streaming deal where people can consume content for a flat low monthly fee. Most people want easy access to content and will sacrifice quality to get it.

Both are LG 31MU97-B at 4096x2160. They are fantastic. Great color and vivid picture.When using photoshop, the interface is painfully slow. When selecting a layer, there is up to a 1 second lag.

It's really slow.Editing images works. No lag with the pen tool or the paintbrush. Working in 16 bit on 8000x8000px images with 70 layers is just as fast as a 3 layer 8-bit image (and the interface is just as slow).I have a Windows 10 machine (similar processors, 64GB RAM, NVidia GeForce 9800GT, SSD boot drive) that experiences NONE of these interface lag issues.

911,"> SD cards are shit for a users experience though.Not quite.Most of the time it's all about cramming lots of discretionary data - basically, anything that doesn't need very fast storage - into a slab of flash the size of a pinky fingernail. For secondary mass storage purposes, they are perfect. I have a 128GB tucked into the SD card slot on my MBP. Even the slowest UHS-1 Class 10's are fast enough to record 4K from a GoPro, as it's a matter of large bulk sequential writes.What they aren't designed for is as a form of system storage. They're optimized for sequential rather than random, so they start behaving like hard drives when you throw random data operations at them. Encryption renders **all** disk operations as random.Most people tend to be price-conscious over microSD cards. Performance doesn't even rear its ugly head until they try to use them for things other than multimedia file storage. The fact is, you don't need 100MB/s read/write for media files; 10MB/s is plenty of bandwidth for compressed audio, for instance.> Most of your customers are idiots. Do not give them any other options to expand on their idiocy.The first part is true to an extent. The second part is just wrong. You will never triumph over stupidity - even with no options available, they will find one and make *you* look stupid for not having them in the first place.",Apple,1449250655,3

913,"While the cost aspect is obvious, I will give Apple the point that SDs can be unreliable and then you have something Apple has no real control over ruin the experience of using their phone. Personally I wanted a phone with plenty of internal memory and was not going to use SD cards anymore due to a SD card from Sandisk dying on me WHEN I HIT SAVE ON THE VIDEO OF MY FIRST KID BEING BORN. I had set up dropbox and google photos autobackup to work via mobile data and one of the two services did upload the file in an unfinished state and kept on uploading files that no longer where getting properly saved in the damaged card. Some online tool saved my bacon and the video was re encoded and saved properly. But yeah I don't trust SD cards for saving data I care about.",Apple,1449250590,2

So I contacted Amazon and asked them if they could replace my missing item. The agent said that they couldn't since it was out of stock and he could issue a refund. I told the agent I didn't want a refund and asked then to contact Canada post so an investigation could be launched. He tells me I will not be refunded and that Canada post will be contacted. I later receive an email saying I've been refunded my money. So I contact Amazon yet again. I explain my situation to the agent and they tell me that they can rectify the situation by sending me a replacement for the ps4 for $368.12 flat. I'm like that's perfect and tell them that's fine. Then I check my orders and I've been issued a replacement for AC syndicate (at $44) and not the ps4. The agent clearly lied to me as she said $368.12 is what I would be charged and then went and replaced the $44 game (which is the only part of the order I received). Then I contacted Amazon again and they said they couldn't help me and wouldn't speak with me. Will I get my money back for the missing ps4 or will Amazon just keep my $369.99+tax?

1001,"*Below is an email I've sent to Amazon Customer Support about my problem.  I thought I would share my experience with the group...*Amazon service has really gone down hill lately.  I am sending you this note in hopes that Amazon will learn from it's mistakes and improve service.I ordered a case for my new Nexus 9 early on 12/2.  The order confirmation email said it would arrive on 12/4, which is what I expected with 2 day Amazon Prime shipping.Today I noticed the UPS SurePost tracking info (**REDACTED**) shows no movement at all since it was put into the system on 12/2. At 03:01 PM PST today (12/4) I web chatted with your customer service rep Roman.  He did the best he could, but it was clear he didn't have any more info then I did about the situation.  He first suggested I wait it out and offered to follow up at midnight on 12/8 (""I'll set a follow up for Tuesday, December 8, 2015 12:00 AM (PST)"").  Following up at midnight seemed odd, but I figured he must have meant 12:00 PM.I told him that wasn't acceptable.  He said ""I totally understand that you're upset about this situation Dan, we are still having a chance to get this order delivered by tomorrow however, right now, I don't want to set false expectations on this situation. I'll be following up with you to make sure the delivery of this item will happen.""It seems he is not willing and/or able to take any action to solve the problem.  In fact his bar seem to be set very low at just making sure it gets delivered at all.  I pay good money for Amazon Prime and I expect Amazon to live up to it's quoted delivery dates.I thought he might have been able to resend the item with overnight delivery or locate the package in the system, but the only option offered to me was to wait and see if it showed up sometime between now and next Tuesday.Roman didn't offer any form of compensation for missing the delivery date. I had to specifically ask him to compensate me for the mistake which he did happily.  I assume these are his instructions from Amazon Management as a cost cutting technique.  Fair enough, I don't mind asking for what I feel is appropriate.I thanked Roman for his help and ended the chat.  I was prompted with a window asking if my problem had been solved.  I said it had not and was given another window asking for another chance (""Thanks for your feedback! Please give us another chance to help you. Click the button below to provide your phone number."")  I figured why not and entered my phone number.The phone rang and I was connected with a nice lady named Tia.  She asked me my name, email address, my shipping address and then said something was weird on my account.  Something about how a request to reset the account was sent in the last 12 hours (or maybe it would be sent in the next 12 hours?)  She said she needed to send me a text with a verification code which I was happy to read back to her.  I'm a big fan of account security and appreciate Amazon going the extra mile to make sure my account is safe and secure.Unfortunately, the system would not accept the code I read to her.  She didn't ask me to re-read it back to her or offer to send it again.  She just said something was weird with my account and she was sorry but she couldn't help me.  I briefly told her my story (above) as I wasn't sure she understood she was a ""second chance"" opportunity.  She apologized again, said she couldn't help me and that someone would contact me within 12 hours.  I asked how they would contact me and she said either phone or email.  I thanked her for her time and we hung up.As far as second chances go, that was pretty disappointing; not something I'm likely to do again.I want to note that in both cases the people I interacted with were both nice and professional.  They just didn't seem to have to ability to solve my problem.  I feel this is an issue with Amazon Management.Now, if not getting a $15 case on time is my biggest problem in life then I'm doing pretty well.  But I think this is indicative of a larger problem at Amazon.  It's been clear for a while that delivering Amazon Prime shipments on time has become less of a guarantee and more of a guideline.  I think in my case the problem sits squarely on the UPS SurePost service that Amazon elected to use.  UPS SurePost is a lowest cost shipping method, not a guaranteed in 2 days shipping method.  I understand if it's not going too far it might happen, but in my opinion it should never be used for Amazon Prime deliveries.If things keep going downhill like this, I can imagine paying yearly for Amazon Prime will stop being valuable to me.  I don't watch any of the Amazon Video content; I only care about the free (supposed to be) 2 day shipping.  Please take my message and others like mine to heart and find a way to improve on your ability to meet your self imposed delivery dates.  I like Amazon Prime and want to keep liking it.",Amazon,1449279089,0

At this point it has cost me 2 hours of driving and I am worried because it is almost the weekend and I don't want to lose income. The advice I got from the email help line was to put the phone in airplane mode, restart the phone, and at last resort to delete and reinstall the app. Having done all of these to no effect I decided to visit Lyft headquarters, which I could do because they are in San Francisco. Was no help at all. They wouldn't even let me in the front door. They said it's a closed site and they don't directly help drivers there. One person did come out and confirm to me that there was a glitch on their end and that more than 50 drivers had this problem before I did. They did not know what it was but it was an error on their system. It has been more than a day and I am still on the same trip. Unfortunately because it's a Lyft line and the price is fixed I am not making any money for the trip continuing (lol) however I am unable to make any other trips either.  This trip has now lasted more that 20 hours.

1405,"This is ridiculous. You can't conceive of an artist being passionate about their music if they don't have to spend their days working at Wal-Mart to survive? It sounds like you have no idea what being a working musician is actually like, and everyone is either some bohemian who spends all their time and energy ~creating~ while their rent and food and bills and clothes are mysteriously paid for, or arena-filling megastars looking to turn their fans upside down and shake them until change comes out of their pockets. What planet are you on?",Spotify,1449262818,6
1406,What are you on about? I didn't say anything about artists not working.,Spotify,1449263988,-1
1407,"They are saying the idea that a musician should be in it solely for the art and not to get paid is too idealistic, and is an unfair standard to hold them to because at the end of the day they need to make money too. They are creating something that people value, so it stands to reason that they should be able to profit from it. Obviously for some artists there comes a point where you are so ridiculously rich this argument might no longer matter, but the principle sort of still stands because A) they made the music and you wouldn't be listening to it if they hadn't, so some sort of compensation seems fair and B) the logic doesn't change just because they made something a lot of people found worth spending money on.Having passion, and the reality of getting paid, don't have to be mutually exclusive, in my opinion.It's a bit like the ""paid mod debacle"" that hit Steam, the gaming service, a while back. Modders wanted to be financially compensated for the work they create, and a huge backlash of negativity resulted because people felt that modifying games was a passion project done as its own reward. Of course, those people failed to take into account the actual people modifying the game spending the equivalent of a second job to produce quality content for games, contributing a significant amount of value to people and receiving none in return for their efforts. If someone makes something valuable, it stands to reason that people should return some value to the creator (in the form of money usually).",Spotify,1449267350,4
1408,"Paid mods was an issue with how they presented it, not the actual principle itself. I would happily pay for mods as long as there was a verified system to prove the money was going towards the person that actually made the mod. Too many people were stealing others work from Nexus Mods and selling it as their own. That's why that was such a problem.Musicians do need to make money as well, and I know that, but there is a difference in making a song solely to appeal to the masses, and making a song because you have a message or a story to tell.

1950,"tough one, but i think the problem is 90% in your mind. how about owning it (as you partly already do by posting here)? maybe not a first date topic, but bringing it up confidently must look very confident (=sexy). source: i'm just guessing, i'm an M.",Tinder,1449244267,1
1951,"And that is why I don't enjoy hookup life - because it's so often treated as just about penetrative sex. Sexuality and intimacy is so much more than that. If hookups were more about pleasure and mutual enjoyment than being focused on penetrative sex, then I think it would be a lot more fun. At the end of the day, penis size is only an issue if it's the guy's personality that's the dick. I say go for it, OP. ",Tinder,1449247027,1

1975,"I suppose my ultimate aim is to find a long-term companion to share life with, but I'm making some awesome friends along the way.  I don't consider myself to be particularly good-looking, and having attractive women wanting to talk to me has really boosted my self-confidence into the bargain, even if I never actually meet 99% of them.  OK, the overwhelming majority of matches never respond, but overall I'm enjoying it so far :-)",Tinder,1449255223,8
1976,How have you made awesome friends through tinder?,Tinder,1449260339,3
1977,I use Tinder mostly to find a relationship. Why I chose it over other options like OKcupid is because I wanted something more casual and light-hearted where I didn't feel like I am pressured into meeting someone on a more serious basis right from the get-go.,Tinder,1449258570,6
1978,"At first, it was because I was hoping to get some people who were looking for casual hook ups, but I'm not attractive enough for that, I think.  I was too afraid to swipe right on the really attractive ones anyway, because I wouldn't know what to do if I matched with one.  So I would only swipe on people I thought were interesting and at my level physically.  I've got a few responses and exchanged a few numbers, but no matter how early or late I suggest meeting, they always end up blowing me off.  Feels pretty shitty and I'm probably going to delete the app.",Tinder,1449255994,3
1979,"If people match you it shows they have some level of interest. I think instead of focusing on your looks you need to think about how your confidence levels affect your how people feel about you. Maybe also try being more persistent.",Tinder,1449284843,2

1982,"Actually I think its a pretty funny story, my friend told me about it because he's one of those dude bros that likes to hook up with as many chicks as possible, I was like sure lets see what happens, I went one swiped through like 3 girls, one popped back as a match and now Her and I have been dating for over a year, so i guess it can be used for many of things, but sometimes shit just happens ",Tinder,1449266705,2
