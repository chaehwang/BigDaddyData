Hello, I am trying to buy a movie in HD to watch on my Windows PC using the Play Movies and TV app, but on the pre-purchase screen it says ""Note: HD purchases will play in SD on this device. Watch HD on Chromecast, Chrome browser, Roku, and most Android devices.""

However, on https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2528768?hl=en, it says that HD playback on Windows machines running Chrome is supported.


When I try to play an HD video on Windows it plays in SD, what gives?

Google, I purchase movies and music all the time. Your products are supposed to be able to stream to my TV. I also have an Amazon Prime account. That has no issue at all streaming to the Roku set. 

You're losing my purchases, Google. I'm now buying movies, shows, music and audio books from Amazon.

This app is bullshit. The results are based off the surface area of the finger used. People usually use more of their finger when they press harder. Force Touch is new hardware, it's more than just detecting pressure. The haptic feedback and linear sensitivity play a huge role. Android has nothing like this, stop pretending like it does.

This is Phil Schiller's Grand Unified Theory of Apple 
http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/schiller-apple-theory/

As a rule, Philip Schiller told MediumÛªs Steven Levy, you should be using the smallest possible device to do as much work as possible, before going to the next largest gadget in line.

He then delivered what Levy described as SchillerÛªs ÛÏgrand philosophical theoryÛ of the Apple product line:

ÛÏThe job of the watch is to do more and more things on your wrist so that you donÛªt need to pick up your phone as often.Û

ÛÏThe job of the phone is to do more and more things such that maybe you donÛªt need your iPad, and it should be always trying and striving to do that.Û

The down side is that ObjC evolved so slowly that problems that from ten years ago still persisted.

This isn't necessarily a zero-sum game. The problems above typically involved things like: uninformative error messages; uncaught quirks with the compiler; poorly named function names; undocumented API features or structures; and weird undocumented behaviors of UI controls. Those are all fixable without compromising old code.

Unfortunately, over the last few years, Xcode and Cocoa have changed so much that this advantage has eroded. Increasingly, I've encountered ""function deprecated"" messages. Code that used to work perfectly now crashes - either because the API that it relies on has changed in some subtle way, or because the steady refactoring of options and features in Xcode and Cocoa have not translated well.

ObjC was great in its day, but it has not aged well. I won't regret leaving it behind while adapting to Swift.

But all of these options handle these semantics in subtly different ways, and thus exhibit different behavior. The names, as colloquial as they are, are unhelpful. So is the help documentation, which provides no clue of which function to invoke in which circumstance, or what the exact behavior is. So when a dev encounters a weird problem, they have to resort to Stack, and [Usenet newsgroup posts from other people wrestling with the same issue *in 2001*](http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/43538-loading-nib-window-and-making-it-key.html).

You get one port for Display+USB + power. It allows for smaller form factors that make the Macbook Retina possible. There are many justifications for it. 

You have to buy a whole new TV to justify 4K.

Not only that you have to buy a huge TV in order to perceive any difference. For example, on a 60"" TV you have to sit 4-6 feet away. If you sit 8-10 feet away you need a 80""+ TV to justify 4K. 

Heavily compressed 4K streaming is barely as good as 1080p Blu-Ray. 

The end user experience with 4K is not that great. This coming from a person that bought a 4K TV 3 months ago. The 4K standard is not there yet. HDR and dolby vision is still being rolled out on TVs. HDR content is so low you can consider it not available. 

4K content providers require much more DRM restrictions. HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 compliance. Which means people like me that bought a 4K capable receiver 2 years ago (4K 30 Hz) now have to buy a new receiver in order to enjoy 4K content or we make do with using the TV's audio output (inferior quality).

The investment needed to just watch 4K content  for me is new TV ($2000+ for 80"" since I sit 8-9 feet away)+ new receiver ($1600-$2000) + the cost of a new entertainment center to fit the gigantic new TV. A new wife that will let me put a TV that big in the living room.  Or a new house with a dedicated media room large enough to fit the new TV. I did what was sensible and feasible got a 60"" TV and on it the difference is barely noticeable from my seat. A decision I made with plans to upgrade the TV and receiver 2 years down the line when 4K has stabilized and become cheaper (OLED). 

I think majority have to make similar compromises in their quest for TV upgrades, which almost makes 4K a marketing tactic like 3D. 

All that for currently available content from Netflix, Amazon + Youtube which is low bit rate and compressed with extremely low selection. 4K Blu-Ray is just coming out and there is almost no content there.   

4K doesn't improve most people's experience in any way. I seriously doubt most people have 65""-80"" TVs in their living room where a $100-$200 4K set top box is suddenly going to improve things for them.

Retina devices on the other hand make sense because people sit or use them from close range. TVs not so much.

Trust me I know all the ins and outs of what content is available and what the compression rates are for streamed 4k content. Every point you have made is valid, and I give you tons of credit for a well thought out and data filled post (so instant up vote for that)

I guess the only thing I'm still hung up on is it takes a lot more effort to argue *against* including 4k than it does to argue *for* it for the ATV4 (or potential ATV5). I'm not going to pretend I know the financial aspect of how much it would actually *cost* Apple to include 4k capability, but it would make sense to *me* that you'd want your users to be able to share their 4k content (from their brand new shiny iPhone 6s) on as many platforms as possible. By including 4k you're only opening yourself to more customers. More people who would instantly buy the ATV simply because it has 4k, and it'd be the easiest way to share 4k content you captured with your iPhone.

I'm sure it would cut the profit margin down some for Apple. But I guess the question becomes would you rather sell fewer units with a higher profit margin, or more units with a slightly lower profit margin. I suppose they answered that question by not including 4k in the ATV 4, but I am curious to see how they answer that question with the ATV 5.",Apple,1449248196,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3vf0la/production_of_faster_apple_tv_5_rumored_to_begin/cxn2s3f,4,25 :: Production of Faster Apple TV 5 Rumored to Begin in Early 2016654,"4K on the iPhone 6s is not enabled by default. Sharing videos, most people do on youtube, Facebook or social media, where 4K doesn't mean anything. The size and bandwidth requirements make it infeasible for sharing. Most don't even share 1080p to be honset. There is a small subset of people that require 4K to record and edit video. By making it a user selectable option it is clear Apple doesn't think 4K is mainstream enough. Even 1080p 60hz is not default on iPhones.  Especially since there is no infrastructure in social media or things most people do to make it worth while to make 4K the default. On iPhones the feature exists because Apple markets it as a device for everyone but also for discerning people that want to do more with it. Those usually tend to have a mac to edit the 4K video in creative ways. 

I think what would make the Apple TV instant buy for most people over 4K is a Apple Music type streaming deal where people can consume content for a flat low monthly fee. Most people want easy access to content and will sacrifice quality to get it. Otherwise Mp3 and stream music won't be more popular than CDs and Netflix wouldn't be more popular than Blu-Rays and DVDs.

No playlists showing and incomplete library. I didn't actually expect it to be helpful, but I was really desperate so I was willing to try anything.

First I tried chat. I got the usual instructions like reinstall, reboot phone, log out and in... everything I tried before I even contacted support. Oh well, they have to do it, I understand. We didn't find a solution and it took almost 2 hours so I ended the chat session because I was so tired and hungry (missed dinner because of it).

A week later, after the first update, I still had the issue. So I contacted support again, this time I got someone who went a bit further and had me try some advanced steps but it didn't help either.  But this time, I was told to wait several days for an email about the issue. I got it after a week and was instructed to call the support to put my account into the troubleshooting mode (=giving access to my account to Apple Engineers). Then I provided some info about my issue and they told me they will look into it.

This is insane. I can't believe it. They actually took the time to try figure out my problem with my account. I would never get this kind of service *anywhere*. Certainly not from Spotify or fucking Google (which I'm using now before I can switch to Apple Music completely). It felt like they actually cared about me and wanted to solve the problem. I've never experienced anything like this and it was awesome. This is what makes me consider switching to an iPhone, even though it's 3x more expensive than my current phone.

I have a new Mac Pro with 64GB of RAM and the top end video hardware (something-700-series ATI, can't remember the name). I am running Photoshop CC 2015. I am not running CC2015.1 yet because I'm in the middle of a project and I don't want to upgrade until I have downtime and can be sure it's stable.

I have 2 4K screens. Both are LG 31MU97-B at 4096x2160. They are fantastic. Great color and vivid picture.

When using photoshop, the interface is painfully slow. When selecting a layer, there is up to a 1 second lag. Double-clicking a layer to add layer styles does not work, I need to triple-click in most cases (not always) because of interface lag. Same thing goes for renaming layers. It's really slow.

Editing images works. No lag with the pen tool or the paintbrush. Working in 16 bit on 8000x8000px images with 70 layers is just as fast as a 3 layer 8-bit image (and the interface is just as slow).

I have a Windows 10 machine (similar processors, 64GB RAM, NVidia GeForce 9800GT, SSD boot drive) that experiences NONE of these interface lag issues. It is speedy and responsive. 

I have dedicated scratch drives on both systems.

I hate the Windows OS, I'm much faster using a Mac. Otherwise, I would just use my PC.

**I have tried:**

* Evernote (Complicated, a lot of unwanted features)

* OneNote (Same as evernote)

* Workflowy (Kind of loved the system, but its not good for long notes, and sorting sometimes gets difficult)

* nvAlt (Not enough format options)

* Notes  (Not sold on it)


**Checking out:**

* Notability

* Letterspace

* Quiver

* Write

* ~~Alternote~~ (Required Evernote...)

I've noticed that throughout the day Safari keeps taking up more and more memory until I've got to kill it because it's very slow - it gets to roughly 3.5GB

I think you mean ""access from my iPhone the photos taken by my camera"". If your camera has WiFi, chances are there's an iOS app by the manufacturer so you can copy pictures from the camera's SD card storage to the iPhone.

No WiFi on the camera? There are a few options:

* SD card + WiFi. These go by such brands as Eye-Fi, Toshiba FlashAir, and others.

* Android device. Seriously though, there are SD card readers that work over USB OTG, and Android is perfect for that purpose: on-the-field playback/review. IIRC Apple's Lightning to SD card reader/USB host port only works for iPads, not iPhones - personally I think this limitation is stupid.

* Battery-powered travel router e.g. HooToo Tripmate. Ideally it should have a SD card slot; failing that, an USB host port so you can plug in your own SD card reader into it.

I want to analyze my iMessage conversations, I had the idea specifically in relation to my significant other, as I was wondering what our first texts were, but then the thought continued, and I wanted to know what our most commonly used words are, maybe make a word cloud, all for the sake of statistical fun (I know, I'm lame, so does my girlfriend, you don't have to tell me). 

I was curious if anyone knew of any applications that would make this process easier. I've done cursory searches, but if this type of application does exist, I don't know what it's called, because I've gotten nowhere in my searches.

Not quite.

Most of the time it's all about cramming lots of discretionary data - basically, anything that doesn't need very fast storage - into a slab of flash the size of a pinky fingernail. For secondary mass storage purposes, they are perfect. I have a 128GB tucked into the SD card slot on my MBP. Even the slowest UHS-1 Class 10's are fast enough to record 4K from a GoPro, as it's a matter of large bulk sequential writes.

What they aren't designed for is as a form of system storage. They're optimized for sequential rather than random, so they start behaving like hard drives when you throw random data operations at them. Encryption renders **all** disk operations as random.

Most people tend to be price-conscious over microSD cards. Performance doesn't even rear its ugly head until they try to use them for things other than multimedia file storage. The fact is, you don't need 100MB/s read/write for media files; 10MB/s is plenty of bandwidth for compressed audio, for instance.

> Most of your customers are idiots. Do not give them any other options to expand on their idiocy.

I told the agent I didn't want a refund and asked then to contact Canada post so an investigation could be launched. He tells me I will not be refunded and that Canada post will be contacted. I later receive an email saying I've been refunded my money. So I contact Amazon yet again. I explain my situation to the agent and they tell me that they can rectify the situation by sending me a replacement for the ps4 for $368.12 flat. I'm like that's perfect and tell them that's fine. Then I check my orders and I've been issued a replacement for AC syndicate (at $44) and not the ps4. The agent clearly lied to me as she said $368.12 is what I would be charged and then went and replaced the $44 game (which is the only part of the order I received).

I thought I would share my experience with the group...*

Amazon service has really gone down hill lately.  I am sending you this note in hopes that Amazon will learn from it's mistakes and improve service.

I ordered a case for my new Nexus 9 early on 12/2.  The order confirmation email said it would arrive on 12/4, which is what I expected with 2 day Amazon Prime shipping.

Today I noticed the UPS SurePost tracking info (**REDACTED**) shows no movement at all since it was put into the system on 12/2. 

At 03:01 PM PST today (12/4) I web chatted with your customer service rep Roman.  He did the best he could, but it was clear he didn't have any more info then I did about the situation.  He first suggested I wait it out and offered to follow up at midnight on 12/8 (""I'll set a follow up for Tuesday, December 8, 2015 12:00 AM (PST)"").  Following up at midnight seemed odd, but I figured he must have meant 12:00 PM.

I told him that wasn't acceptable.  He said ""I totally understand that you're upset about this situation Dan, we are still having a chance to get this order delivered by tomorrow however, right now, I don't want to set false expectations on this situation. I'll be following up with you to make sure the delivery of this item will happen.""

It seems he is not willing and/or able to take any action to solve the problem.  In fact his bar seem to be set very low at just making sure it gets delivered at all.  I pay good money for Amazon Prime and I expect Amazon to live up to it's quoted delivery dates.

I thought he might have been able to resend the item with overnight delivery or locate the package in the system, but the only option offered to me was to wait and see if it showed up sometime between now and next Tuesday.

Roman didn't offer any form of compensation for missing the delivery date. I had to specifically ask him to compensate me for the mistake which he did happily.  I assume these are his instructions from Amazon Management as a cost cutting technique.  Fair enough, I don't mind asking for what I feel is appropriate.

I thanked Roman for his help and ended the chat.  I was prompted with a window asking if my problem had been solved.  I said it had not and was given another window asking for another chance (""Thanks for your feedback! Please give us another chance to help you. Click the button below to provide your phone number."")  I figured why not and entered my phone number.

The phone rang and I was connected with a nice lady named Tia.  She asked me my name, email address, my shipping address and then said something was weird on my account.  Something about how a request to reset the account was sent in the last 12 hours (or maybe it would be sent in the next 12 hours?)  She said she needed to send me a text with a verification code which I was happy to read back to her.  I'm a big fan of account security and appreciate Amazon going the extra mile to make sure my account is safe and secure.

Unfortunately, the system would not accept the code I read to her.  She didn't ask me to re-read it back to her or offer to send it again.  She just said something was weird with my account and she was sorry but she couldn't help me.  I briefly told her my story (above) as I wasn't sure she understood she was a ""second chance"" opportunity.  She apologized again, said she couldn't help me and that someone would contact me within 12 hours.  I asked how they would contact me and she said either phone or email.  I thanked her for her time and we hung up.

As far as second chances go, that was pretty disappointing; not something I'm likely to do again.

I want to note that in both cases the people I interacted with were both nice and professional.  They just didn't seem to have to ability to solve my problem.  I feel this is an issue with Amazon Management.

Now, if not getting a $15 case on time is my biggest problem in life then I'm doing pretty well.  But I think this is indicative of a larger problem at Amazon.  It's been clear for a while that delivering Amazon Prime shipments on time has become less of a guarantee and more of a guideline.  I think in my case the problem sits squarely on the UPS SurePost service that Amazon elected to use.  UPS SurePost is a lowest cost shipping method, not a guaranteed in 2 days shipping method.  I understand if it's not going too far it might happen, but in my opinion it should never be used for Amazon Prime deliveries.

If things keep going downhill like this, I can imagine paying yearly for Amazon Prime will stop being valuable to me.  I don't watch any of the Amazon Video content; I only care about the free (supposed to be) 2 day shipping.  Please take my message and others like mine to heart and find a way to improve on your ability to meet your self imposed delivery dates.  I like Amazon Prime and want to keep liking it.

My phone had decent cell signal at the time. After repeated attempts to end the trip I even tried to cancel the trip. No dice. 
I emailed the Lyft  support line and moved to another area of the city where I had a very strong cell signal and still got the same error. That there was a data connection error and the app would not end the trip. At this point it has cost me 2 hours of driving and I am worried because it is almost the weekend and I don't want to lose income. 
The advice I got from the email help line was to put the phone in airplane mode, restart the phone, and at last resort to delete and reinstall the app. Having done all of these to no effect I decided to visit Lyft headquarters, which I could do because they are in San Francisco. Was no help at all. They wouldn't even let me in the front door. They said it's a closed site and they don't directly help drivers there. One person did come out and confirm to me that there was a glitch on their end and that more than 50 drivers had this problem before I did. They did not know what it was but it was an error on their system. 
It has been more than a day and I am still on the same trip. Unfortunately because it's a Lyft line and the price is fixed I am not making any money for the trip continuing (lol) however I am unable to make any other trips either.  
This trip has now lasted more that 20 hours. I can tell because my daily driving summary shows that I drove all day yesterday (17 hours) and I assume it is still going on today.

> New for Fitbit Charge HR & Fitbit Surge Users!
> 
> TRACKING EXERCISE IS NOW EASIER WITH SMARTTRACK
> 
> Tracking workouts on Fitbit Surge and Fitbit Charge HR is easier and smarter than ever thanks to a new feature called SmartTrack. Now your tracker will automatically recognize that youÛªve done an exercise, identify the type of activity, and record it in the Fitbit app.
> 
> SmartTrack only recognizes workouts or activities where there is continuous movementÛÓthings like walking, running, outdoor biking, and elliptical, as well as high-movement sports, such as tennis, basketball, and soccer, among others, and workout classes that keep you moving, like cardio-kickboxing and Zumba.
> 
> SmartTrack can also be personalized. All you need to do is go to the exercise settings in your Fitbit app and select which SmartTrack activities you want to be recognized as workouts. You can also adjust the number of minutes you need to perform each activity in order for it to count towards your exercise goal. For example, SmartTrack can be set to record your 30-minute power walk at lunch, and ignore your casual, after-dinner stroll. (The default setting for SmartTrack is 15 minutes, but you can adjust it to capture activities that last 10 minutes, 90 minutes, and everything in between.)
>

Resting burn represents the number of calories your body burns  just by being alive (also called metabolic burn). Young people and males tend to have higher metabolic burn rates, and UP calculates this based on your age, gender, and BMI.
Active burn represents the additional calories you've burnt by moving around. UP calculates this based on your step counts, and also the activities you label in the app (soccer, yoga, run, etc) and how strenuous you report the activities being.

Today I noticed payments going out of my PayPal account from Microsoft. I have an Xbox One and purchased my membership for the whole year. Pre paid. I've just realised that they have been taking money from me every month. On PayPal I've checked my ""pre-approved"" payments and noticed I have two recurring payments for Microsoft saved in here. One of them totaling a sum of å£290, the other is å£141!! What on earth is this. There is no way I have any service with them that would have cost me this?! I pre paid my whole years membership. That's å£40. Not two separate monthly subscriptions now totaling to å£330 that represent nothing! This is theft!

How can I report this. Or can someone please explain to me. I'm extremely pissed off. In my Microsoft billing account there are no subscriptions anywhere.

Check under here https://account.microsoft.com/services to see which service may be set to charge monthly.  
After that check here : https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders#/ for the past orders made for your account.  
If there is nothing there, dig up your paypal receipt email. When I pay for something in the Store with paypal, it says what I have paid for.     
If you have not pre-approved the transactions with Microsoft, it is possible that someone made a payment without informing you. Could be a hack, could be a family/friend.

Microsoft doesn't have a great view of the process until it ships after its finalized and confirmed because they don't have hands on and Dell is customizing the item.

They are creating something that people value, so it stands to reason that they should be able to profit from it. Obviously for some artists there comes a point where you are so ridiculously rich this argument might no longer matter, but the principle sort of still stands because A) they made the music and you wouldn't be listening to it if they hadn't, so some sort of compensation seems fair and B) the logic doesn't change just because they made something a lot of people found worth spending money on.

Having passion, and the reality of getting paid, don't have to be mutually exclusive, in my opinion.

It's a bit like the ""paid mod debacle"" that hit Steam, the gaming service, a while back. Modders wanted to be financially compensated for the work they create, and a huge backlash of negativity resulted because people felt that modifying games was a passion project done as its own reward. Of course, those people failed to take into account the actual people modifying the game spending the equivalent of a second job to produce quality content for games, contributing a significant amount of value to people and receiving none in return for their efforts. If someone makes something valuable, it stands to reason that people should return some value to the creator (in the form of money usually).",Spotify,1449267350,https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/3vfqbt/why_doesnt_spotify_make_some_albums_premium_only/cxnfwho,4,12 :: Why doesn't Spotify make some albums premium only?1408,"Paid mods was an issue with how they presented it, not the actual principle itself.

Asana is super useful! Love their developers! I have heard from some people though that Asana can be limited to scheduling, rather than actually processing tasks. Still love it!

Evernote also just came out with a sort of template regime: https://help.evernote.com/hc/articles/209006007 

If you are thinking of trying Asana read on and learn a bit more about the tools!

Most entrepreneurs will tell you that time-tracking and project management tools help them not only stay effective, but also become more successful. 

What you choose for yourself or your team really depends upon three facts: 

1. How willing you are to let go of your current software, and utilize and all-in-one tool to become more efficient. 

2. The vertical in which you and your business operates. 

3. How much flexibility and creativity you want within the program. Most, if not all successful startups deal with a need for effective process management, workflow, and organization.

With something like Transpose, you can create solutions such as templates, records, and notes. You can track orders, view inventory, enhance projects and manage content. With a simple drag-n-drop editor you get to pick from a wide selection of data fields including dates, time, files, contacts or even transcribed voice recording.

Here are some examples of what something like Transpose can do!

**IT Management:** * Smart Database for Asset Management * Help Desk Ticket and Tracker Forms * Office Relocation Records (and request online form) * Asset Management (Barcode reader in iOS and Android) * Servers, Logins/Accounts.

**Operation & Company Management:** * Web Forms for Work Orders * Voice Field for Recording Sales Meetings * Company Goals Tracker * Team Objectives Tracker * Team Vacation Planner * Meeting Agenda * Attendance and Follow Up * Meeting Action Items Tracker * Simple Project Task List.

**Sales and Marketing:** * Sales Pipeline * Customer Needs Analysis * Outbound Sales Campaign plan * Sales Activity Tracker * Share Customer Contact List * Sales Pipeline By Rep, By Size, By Stage, By Summary (view) * Customer Needs Analysis * Content Marketing: Running a Business Blog * Marketing Campaign Analysis * Marketing Quarterly Goals * Marketing Team Objectives * Sales Activity Tracker (by rep and month) * Shared Customer Contact List and Form * Sales Training Development Guide * Content Calendar/ Blogging Calendar/ Long Form Content * Event Plan and Budget * Event Registration Web Form * PR Activity Tracker * PR Event Tracker * PR Coverage Tracker * PPC Advertising Recurring Tasks Tracker * Website Change Request Tracker and Web Form

**Human Resources:** * Web Forms to Submit Resumes, Time-off Requests, Suggestion Box, Scheduling Meetings * Kanban For Applicant Tracking * Smart Database For Job Description Organizing * Calendar For Holidays, Time-off * Record Interviews * Organize Performance Reviews * Assigned To Field * Job Application Web Form * Applicant Tracker * Resume Upload and Application Web Form * New Hire Checklist * Employee Objectives and Performance Reviews * Employee Review Checklist * Employee Directory * Employee Termination Documentation * Monthly Personnel Activity Tracker * Interview Process/Workflow * Internal Job Requisition Form * Suggestion Box With Web Form

**Project Management and Product Development:** * Kanban For Project Management * Collaboration For Teams * Feature Backlog and Prioritization * Agile Software * Issues and Bug Tracker * Product User Feedback Online

**Also Employee/Team Productivity and Finance**

So please try them all! See what you like best! 

There are a number of other apps like Trello, Notable, JIRA and others but each would give you one view for your data; on kanban boards, in spreadsheets or calendars, you would have to connect all those different apps together though with something like Zapier or IFTTT to send and duplicate data between them all. Transpose offers those views as well and using the same data you already have. Check it out! would love to know what do you think..
