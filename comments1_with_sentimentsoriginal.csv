Sharing videos, most people do on youtube, Facebook or social media, where 4K doesn't mean anything. The size and bandwidth requirements make it infeasible for sharing. Most don't even share 1080p to be honset. There is a small subset of people that require 4K to record and edit video. By making it a user selectable option it is clear Apple doesn't think 4K is mainstream enough. Even 1080p 60hz is not default on iPhones.  Especially since there is no infrastructure in social media or things most people do to make it worth while to make 4K the default. On iPhones the feature exists because Apple markets it as a device for everyone but also for discerning people that want to do more with it. Those usually tend to have a mac to edit the 4K video in creative ways. I think what would make the Apple TV instant buy for most people over 4K is a Apple Music type streaming deal where people can consume content for a flat low monthly fee. Most people want easy access to content and will sacrifice quality to get it. Otherwise Mp3 and stream music won't be more popular than CDs and Netflix wouldn't be more popular than Blu-Rays and DVDs.

Young people and males tend to have higher metabolic burn rates, and UP calculates this based on your age, gender, and BMI.Active burn represents the additional calories you've burnt by moving around. UP calculates this based on your step counts, and also the activities you label in the app (soccer, yoga, run, etc) and how strenuous you report the activities being. Basically, the more info you give the app, the more accurate it can be. Total burn is equivalent to resting burn plus active burn.

I am running Photoshop CC 2015. I am not running CC2015.1 yet because I'm in the middle of a project and I don't want to upgrade until I have downtime and can be sure it's stable.I have 2 4K screens. Both are LG 31MU97-B at 4096x2160. They are fantastic. Great color and vivid picture.When using photoshop, the interface is painfully slow. When selecting a layer, there is up to a 1 second lag. Double-clicking a layer to add layer styles does not work, I need to triple-click in most cases (not always) because of interface lag. Same thing goes for renaming layers. It's really slow.Editing images works. No lag with the pen tool or the paintbrush. Working in 16 bit on 8000x8000px images with 70 layers is just as fast as a 3 layer 8-bit image (and the interface is just as slow).I have a Windows 10 machine (similar processors, 64GB RAM, NVidia GeForce 9800GT, SSD boot drive) that experiences NONE of these interface lag issues. It is speedy and responsive. I have dedicated scratch drives on both systems.I hate the Windows OS, I'm much faster using a Mac.

I was told that the item would arrive that Thursday (yesterday). On Wednesday the item said it delivered but I never received it. I called the post office but they didn't get it either. So I contacted Amazon and asked them if they could replace my missing item. The agent said that they couldn't since it was out of stock and he could issue a refund. I told the agent I didn't want a refund and asked then to contact Canada post so an investigation could be launched. He tells me I will not be refunded and that Canada post will be contacted. I later receive an email saying I've been refunded my money. So I contact Amazon yet again. I explain my situation to the agent and they tell me that they can rectify the situation by sending me a replacement for the ps4 for $368.12 flat. I'm like that's perfect and tell them that's fine. Then I check my orders and I've been issued a replacement for AC syndicate (at $44) and not the ps4. The agent clearly lied to me as she said $368.12 is what I would be charged and then went and replaced the $44 game (which is the only part of the order I received). Then I contacted Amazon again and they said they couldn't help me and wouldn't speak with me. Will I get my money back for the missing ps4 or will Amazon just keep my $369.99+tax?

My phone had decent cell signal at the time. After repeated attempts to end the trip I even tried to cancel the trip. No dice. I emailed the Lyft  support line and moved to another area of the city where I had a very strong cell signal and still got the same error. That there was a data connection error and the app would not end the trip. At this point it has cost me 2 hours of driving and I am worried because it is almost the weekend and I don't want to lose income. The advice I got from the email help line was to put the phone in airplane mode, restart the phone, and at last resort to delete and reinstall the app. Having done all of these to no effect I decided to visit Lyft headquarters, which I could do because they are in San Francisco. Was no help at all. They wouldn't even let me in the front door. They said it's a closed site and they don't directly help drivers there. One person did come out and confirm to me that there was a glitch on their end and that more than 50 drivers had this problem before I did. They did not know what it was but it was an error on their system. It has been more than a day and I am still on the same trip. Unfortunately because it's a Lyft line and the price is fixed I am not making any money for the trip continuing (lol) however I am unable to make any other trips either.  This trip has now lasted more that 20 hours. I can tell because my daily driving summary shows that I drove all day yesterday (17 hours) and I assume it is still going on today. I now have to drive for uber or forego any income this weekend.

You get one port for Display+USB + power. It allows for smaller form factors that make the Macbook Retina possible. There are many justifications for it. You have to buy a whole new TV to justify 4K.Not only that you have to buy a huge TV in order to perceive any difference. For example, on a 60"" TV you have to sit 4-6 feet away. If you sit 8-10 feet away you need a 80""+ TV to justify 4K. Heavily compressed 4K streaming is barely as good as 1080p Blu-Ray. The end user experience with 4K is not that great. This coming from a person that bought a 4K TV 3 months ago. The 4K standard is not there yet. HDR and dolby vision is still being rolled out on TVs. HDR content is so low you can consider it not available. 4K content providers require much more DRM restrictions. HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 compliance. Which means people like me that bought a 4K capable receiver 2 years ago (4K 30 Hz) now have to buy a new receiver in order to enjoy 4K content or we make do with using the TV's audio output (inferior quality).The investment needed to just watch 4K content  for me is new TV ($2000+ for 80"" since I sit 8-9 feet away)+ new receiver ($1600-$2000) + the cost of a new entertainment center to fit the gigantic new TV. A new wife that will let me put a TV that big in the living room.  Or a new house with a dedicated media room large enough to fit the new TV. I did what was sensible and feasible got a 60"" TV and on it the difference is barely noticeable from my seat. A decision I made with plans to upgrade the TV and receiver 2 years down the line when 4K has stabilized and become cheaper (OLED). I think majority have to make similar compromises in their quest for TV upgrades, which almost makes 4K a marketing tactic like 3D. All that for currently available content from Netflix, Amazon + Youtube which is low bit rate and compressed with extremely low selection. 4K Blu-Ray is just coming out and there is almost no content there.   4K doesn't improve most people's experience in any way. I seriously doubt most people have 65""-80"" TVs in their living room where a $100-$200 4K set top box is suddenly going to improve things for them.Retina devices on the other hand make sense because people sit or use them from close range.

For secondary mass storage purposes, they are perfect. I have a 128GB tucked into the SD card slot on my MBP. Even the slowest UHS-1 Class 10's are fast enough to record 4K from a GoPro, as it's a matter of large bulk sequential writes.What they aren't designed for is as a form of system storage. They're optimized for sequential rather than random, so they start behaving like hard drives when you throw random data operations at them. Encryption renders **all** disk operations as random.Most people tend to be price-conscious over microSD cards. Performance doesn't even rear its ugly head until they try to use them for things other than multimedia file storage. The fact is, you don't need 100MB/s read/write for media files; 10MB/s is plenty of bandwidth for compressed audio, for instance.> Most of your customers are idiots. Do not give them any other options to expand on their idiocy.The first part is true to an extent. The second part is just wrong.

I thought I would share my experience with the group...*Amazon service has really gone down hill lately.  I am sending you this note in hopes that Amazon will learn from it's mistakes and improve service.I ordered a case for my new Nexus 9 early on 12/2.  The order confirmation email said it would arrive on 12/4, which is what I expected with 2 day Amazon Prime shipping.Today I noticed the UPS SurePost tracking info (**REDACTED**) shows no movement at all since it was put into the system on 12/2. At 03:01 PM PST today (12/4) I web chatted with your customer service rep Roman.  He did the best he could, but it was clear he didn't have any more info then I did about the situation.  He first suggested I wait it out and offered to follow up at midnight on 12/8 (""I'll set a follow up for Tuesday, December 8, 2015 12:00 AM (PST)"").  Following up at midnight seemed odd, but I figured he must have meant 12:00 PM.I told him that wasn't acceptable.  He said ""I totally understand that you're upset about this situation Dan, we are still having a chance to get this order delivered by tomorrow however, right now, I don't want to set false expectations on this situation. I'll be following up with you to make sure the delivery of this item will happen.""It seems he is not willing and/or able to take any action to solve the problem.  In fact his bar seem to be set very low at just making sure it gets delivered at all.  I pay good money for Amazon Prime and I expect Amazon to live up to it's quoted delivery dates.I thought he might have been able to resend the item with overnight delivery or locate the package in the system, but the only option offered to me was to wait and see if it showed up sometime between now and next Tuesday.Roman didn't offer any form of compensation for missing the delivery date. I had to specifically ask him to compensate me for the mistake which he did happily.  I assume these are his instructions from Amazon Management as a cost cutting technique.  Fair enough, I don't mind asking for what I feel is appropriate.I thanked Roman for his help and ended the chat.  I was prompted with a window asking if my problem had been solved.  I said it had not and was given another window asking for another chance (""Thanks for your feedback! Please give us another chance to help you. Click the button below to provide your phone number."")  I figured why not and entered my phone number.The phone rang and I was connected with a nice lady named Tia.  She asked me my name, email address, my shipping address and then said something was weird on my account.  Something about how a request to reset the account was sent in the last 12 hours (or maybe it would be sent in the next 12 hours?)  She said she needed to send me a text with a verification code which I was happy to read back to her.  I'm a big fan of account security and appreciate Amazon going the extra mile to make sure my account is safe and secure.Unfortunately, the system would not accept the code I read to her.  She didn't ask me to re-read it back to her or offer to send it again.  She just said something was weird with my account and she was sorry but she couldn't help me.  I briefly told her my story (above) as I wasn't sure she understood she was a ""second chance"" opportunity.  She apologized again, said she couldn't help me and that someone would contact me within 12 hours.  I asked how they would contact me and she said either phone or email.  I thanked her for her time and we hung up.As far as second chances go, that was pretty disappointing; not something I'm likely to do again.I want to note that in both cases the people I interacted with were both nice and professional.  They just didn't seem to have to ability to solve my problem.  I feel this is an issue with Amazon Management.Now, if not getting a $15 case on time is my biggest problem in life then I'm doing pretty well.  But I think this is indicative of a larger problem at Amazon.  It's been clear for a while that delivering Amazon Prime shipments on time has become less of a guarantee and more of a guideline.  I think in my case the problem sits squarely on the UPS SurePost service that Amazon elected to use.  UPS SurePost is a lowest cost shipping method, not a guaranteed in 2 days shipping method.  I understand if it's not going too far it might happen, but in my opinion it should never be used for Amazon Prime deliveries.If things keep going downhill like this, I can imagine paying yearly for Amazon Prime will stop being valuable to me.  I don't watch any of the Amazon Video content; I only care about the free (supposed to be) 2 day shipping.  Please take my message and others like mine to heart and find a way to improve on your ability to meet your self imposed delivery dates.  I like Amazon Prime and want to keep liking it.",Amazon,1449279089,0,A1K9WP8Q74E9G2,-1,-1,2015-12-05 07:11:43 UTC31JUPBOORNF19JF7MXFVE71GWKDL87,1399,It would be quite difficult for an artist to make free 'passionate' music when they are struggling to make a living and house and feed themselves.,Spotify,1449261242,1,A38DC3BG1ZCVZ2,-1,-1,2015-12-05 06:56:27 UTC3GITHABACYWGB4G3ITM9H8S2FFM2NO,637,Exactly.

They are creating something that people value, so it stands to reason that they should be able to profit from it. Obviously for some artists there comes a point where you are so ridiculously rich this argument might no longer matter, but the principle sort of still stands because A) they made the music and you wouldn't be listening to it if they hadn't, so some sort of compensation seems fair and B) the logic doesn't change just because they made something a lot of people found worth spending money on.Having passion, and the reality of getting paid, don't have to be mutually exclusive, in my opinion.It's a bit like the ""paid mod debacle"" that hit Steam, the gaming service, a while back. Modders wanted to be financially compensated for the work they create, and a huge backlash of negativity resulted because people felt that modifying games was a passion project done as its own reward.

If someone makes something valuable, it stands to reason that people should return some value to the creator (in the form of money usually).",Spotify,1449267350,4,A1NM7ZPZ3NH412,-1,-1,2015-12-05 06:57:32 UTC3QX22DUVOOSJQDT5U2RK6Y0D7N5MVG,461,"I second that, the 'death' part implies that the whole computer freezes up/crashes when in reality it is nothing more than an annoyance.",Apple,1449249708,14,A2VRQML8Q3XYP4,-1,-1,2015-12-05 07:01:20 UTC38Z7YZ2SB3D5PM7XNOZI8IUO9M6IQ2,647,"How do you expect 4k to go mainstream unless companies start including it in their products?

The problems above typically involved things like: uninformative error messages; uncaught quirks with the compiler; poorly named function names; undocumented API features or structures; and weird undocumented behaviors of UI controls. Those are all fixable without compromising old code.Unfortunately, over the last few years, Xcode and Cocoa have changed so much that this advantage has eroded. Increasingly, I've encountered ""function deprecated"" messages. Code that used to work perfectly now crashes - either because the API that it relies on has changed in some subtle way, or because the steady refactoring of options and features in Xcode and Cocoa have not translated well.ObjC was great in its day, but it has not aged well.

Their whole business model is to become the internet equivalent of a newspaper coupon page, but newspapers are dying a slow death, coupons are now mailed out, too, and are guaranteed to be for local businesses, so the ""normal"" kinds of discounts businesses use for coupons are not attractive to Groupon's customers.So what does Groupon (and LivingSocial, etc) do? They bite the hand that feeds them by making themselves look big to the local businesses (touting the rare, lottery-like windfalls some businesses received from their online coupons) to extract more impressive coupons for their users that actually damage the local business when (predictably) a swarm of people come to take advantage of the local business.So the local businesses learn that and stop offering these extravagent coupons -- most just recognize that their local coupons going into the mail or newspapers in their area cover 95% of their potential customers (only teenagers with part-time jobs that still live at home *might* not have access to the coupons because their parents throw them out before they see them), and drop Groupon and the like, while the ones that stay are generally boutique shops that play up to the vanity of their upper and upper-middle class customers that think they're smart for signing up with the company to get their coupons that are now essentially identical (but probably prettier-looking with more flattering text).Groupon's and LivingSocial's value comes from the fee they skim off of using those coupons.

I know of a few local newspaper websites that make more money from selling their own Groupon-like deals than from the ads on their website.    On top of having the daily deal brand, what Groupon does have is some technology.  Look at Groupon Now.  Let's say you own a restaurant and you're having a slow night.  You can instantly run a Groupon, and it'll be seen by all in the area who have the mobile app.   If Groupon is smart, they'd push these ideas rather than the planned deals, which are what they're known for.  You are 99% correct in the problems you point out.  But, I believe that those could be overcome and can be worth a lot of money (billions- I don't know).    Do I work for them? No.  I have a few friends who do in various departments.  I do believe that they have other serious problems that threaten their long-run success, beyond what you mention.",Groupon,,11,,1,,,,"That's still a very ""race-to-the-bottom"", margin-destroying mechanism that businesses will be wary of. If a restaurant is willing to drop their margins on a slow night like that with special discounts based on customer volume, and that takes off, then that will produce a feedback loop just like the feedback loop that was wrecking the retail industry around Christmastime where customers will become accustomed to the lower price and will choose which restaurant to go to depending on whether or not they have a Groupon Now deal.So margins get squeezed out further and the restaurant industry starts collapsing until the restaurant density (normalized to population density) can handle this (restaurants get enough customers that they can keep their margins high enough, and simply advertise Groupon Now deals that are essentially the same as what was charged beforehand.But at that point, when a restaurant is effectively raising and lowering their price hourly, why not just cut out the middleman and offer these prices directly, and simply state that there's a ""low-volume"" price and a ""high-volume"" price, so some people will just show up for dinner at 4PM or 8PM instead of 5-6PM to get the low-volume price, and days where things are slow get the low-volume price and likely some sort of Google Maps integration of restaurant pricing and the restaurant doesn't have to pay to disseminate this information unlike Groupon informs the shoppers who want the better price at the better time where to go, and both consumer and producer maximize gain without the third-party drag.I'm exactly saying that right now imperfect information provided to both consumer and producer about each other produce market inefficiencies so some consumers are ""ripped off"" by producers and vice versa, and Groupon Now could certainly be the *catalyzer* to eliminate them, but once the catalyzation is complete you don't need the catalyzer, anymore.Again, how could Groupon be worth billions of dollars when the company will simply shake up a market until they shake themselves out?",Groupon,,14,,-1,,,,"It can be worth billions of dollars in the interim until the market stabilizes around the new adjusted normal prices you postulate.   Something might not be worth a billion dollars down the road, but it can still be worth a billion dollars right now under certain circumstances.  Like if Groupon is still in the phase where they can make profit.It may be worthwhile to pay a 38 year old superstar baseball player 8 million dollars one year, but the next year he's not worth anything because he's too old to play at that point.    It's not the best of analogies, but the value of commodities is rarely fixed.   Groupon can still make a lot of cash right now (like hiring that 8m/year player for one year to try and win a championship) even if its long-term prospects are less than rosy.You are totally right though.",Groupon,,4,,1,,,,"I sorta agree with you, but I think their superstar player has already reached retirement age. Their time to actually remake the restaurant and other local business industry was back when Google made their offer and they hadn't yet pissed off the local businesses.Now copy-cats are a dime-a-dozen as mentioned elsewhere in this discussion so their own margins are being destroyed, and getting businesses to jump on their risky plan will be more difficult since they're less trusted than they were before.",Groupon,,3,,-1,,,,The other problem is essentially zero barrier to entry.

And before I be critical, let me say that you are the fucking man/woman for having the balls to start a company and you actually got out there and did the damn thing so huge props. But back to the idea itself. Supplements, being often new and not at all understood, offer a smokescreen for the seller. They can brand however they want.

They will, however, make you swole. And there a bunch of people out there who are into that. That's really your niche.  People who bodybuild but don't dunk tank themselves bi-monthly to measure BMI. If you want to market to health nuts, you will have to promise a tighter offering of grass-fed no hate whatevers. If you want to sell to people who want to get swole, use that language.

I'm sure this is why a lot of these snack box subscriptions exist in the first place. I'm loathe to go around and buy a box of each and every little snack just to see if I like them and then have them sitting around when I don't . Plus I only have access to certain sizes, whereas a company like Op's might be able to make a deal with various vendors to make a smaller snack pack.

Lots of what you show on the site is available to me all over the place (supermarket, gym, 7-11, drug store, etc.) so even if you're selling the convenience aspect, I'm already going to these places.Tell me you'll only send me the best quality snacks with good quality protein, low sugar, good taste etc. The value for me in a service like yours is that you can scour the planet for the sorts of things I don't have at my local supermarket/gym/7-11 and send it to me so I can try it and then buy the stuff I like in larger quantities.Follow up on that where if I like something, I can just order that from you on a regular basis. That way I can order the stuff I know I like but still get some new things each month to keep trying new stuff.Let me provide feedback so if I say I hate X Brand protein bar, I know I won't get it again. You will run out of new products after a while and have to use previously used products again, so it's important that after 6 months, I don't get stuck with stuff I got early on that I didn't like.You want to find a way to keep your customers after they get sick of the random box service. Being able to say, ""Here's the 4 things you said you really love, we'll just send you more of those each month, how many do you want?"" is a great way to keep those hard won customers.Later on you can expand beyond protein snacks. Trials of preworkout and whatever the trendy supplement of the moment is will let you mix things up and entice me to stay on longer. Because after a short time, I'm going to find some protein snacks I like and just stick with those.$15/mo is cheap, maybe too cheap. I'd rather pay more and know I'm getting good quality stuff that I can't find around me (or at least not easily). Paying $15 for the same cheap stuff that's everywhere I shop buys me nothing. I can pay the same price for the same stuff already without going a bit out of my way.Set yourself apart.",Birchbox,,2,,0,,,,I love the thoughts. I'm a little scared with going into the high end stuff because I worry that people won't sign up at a 30 dollar price point. It's gonna be even more money invested (a lot more) with no guaranteed return. This pivot scares me. Thoughts?,Birchbox,,1,,0,,,,"The only way to really find out what people are willing to pay for is to test different offerings and at different price points. You could offer two levels, a ""pro"" and ""premium"" or whatever you want to call them. It's more work but it gives a choice and lets you cover more of the potential market.But you have to clearly define what your unique sales proposition is. What exactly are you offering to people that they should pay you for? Is it convenience? Well, in that case, if you're offering the same stuff someone can get at the pharmacy or grocery store or gym that they're already going to, there's no real convenience. If you're offering hard to find items, things they can't get in their existing routine, things they have to make an extra effort to find and order, then you're offering convenience.Since you're not making any actual products, you can't really offer someone something they can't already get. If you can buy it, so can they. So it seems you're a convenience play and that goes back to what I mentioned earlier.Look at providing only the best or at least rare (but still good) products. You can do the lower price point and still find more exotic snacks than what's on the shelf at Wallgreens.People pay $3.50-$5.00 a bar for this stuff all day long. I'd say people would be willing to pay $25 a month for good stuff they can't get locally.Without researching the actual items and their bulk cost, I can't say what price points to try. You'll just have to make a list of items, try them out yourself, decide which are worth including and work out the price from there.Keep in mind, it's better to go for the higher price and higher margin even if you make less overall when you're getting started. The last thing you want is to go after a high volume, low margin market demographic where you're working your ass off to fill orders and making almost nothing for it. Buying snacks in bulk and shipping them to a company to handle fulfillment (or shipping on your own) is something anyone can do.What's going to make or break you is your marketing and advertising. The higher your margin, the more you can afford to spend per customer acquisition.

So, I might be in (what I think should be) your potential demographic. Let me think through your target audience with you:The weight-lifting bros I know that eat the kind of snacks you are selling are guys who are very young - mostly early 20's. They can very quickly and easily find this kind of stuff at their 7-11 or grocery store. They are the kind of guys who have time to dedicate to serious weight lifting - and they are the kind of  guys who are not concerned about getting a subscription service, because they HAVE the time to go to the store and pick those snacks up. A subscription service, by nature, is helpful for people who don't have the time/energy to pick stuff out.So, let me tell you about me. I am a 32 year old woman. I weight lift 3x a week, an hour each time. I eat a high-protein diet. I am always on the go. I have four kids. I am FRANTIC for time. I also am extremely health-conscious, as many women my age are. I would say about 50% of my girlfriends my age are doing crossfit/paleo right now. I have subscribed to multiple snack subscription services, and have always been disappointed. I eat largely Paleo, and love a good, high-quality protein-filled snack. However, these haven't been easy to find with other subscription services. SO here is what a subscription service should offer, and who it should target:* People who are into a lifestyle, but barely have the time to mantain it, and are looking for shortcuts and ways to help them out. That is not going to be 20-something guys who use the word ""swole"". It's going to be women with kids, dads in their 30's, and uys and girls in their late 20's who barely squeeze time in at the gym between their busy lives, etc. * A subscription should be offering something that is harder to find than what I can just grab at the store. People who are into their bodies, who are into weight lifting, who want to look good - they want to feel good, too. They want high-quality snacks, with no refined sugar and no weird ingredients. And trust me, they are willing to pay a premium for it. I would KILL for a really gorgeous trail mix with high quality chocolate and a good quality nut mix.* Do you know what made me sign up for my previous subscription services? Because i was fucking HUNGRY and there was nothing in the house to eat. As I sat and scrolled through the gorgeous pictures of gleaming snacks on the Naturebox website, it took zero prodding for me to try it out. Your pictures will be the enticement, so they need to be good. Hire a food stylist, or at the very least, head over to the food section of pinterest. Study what makes a picture of food look appealing, and then recreate it. * Your whole website needs a revamp. Big time. It's not clean or clear and it doesn't flow well. A one-page layout would work wonders for you guys.SO all of that to say: I think you are currently targeting the wrong demographic. I can't overstate enough how many busy 30-somethings I know right now who are into paleo/weightlifting. You have a PERFECT built in audience, but you are wasting it on young bros who could give a shit about subscription services. I think that, while it would be a swerve, it wouldn't be a big one to target a slightly older and more sophisticated audience.",Birchbox,,0,,0,,,,"Hey, thanks for the feedback. We're seriously exploring the idea of higher quality items, but the price point goes up dramatically. What would your comfort zone be price-wise?* I believe that you're partially correct here, but I know plenty of very busy (college students, working professionals, etc.) skinny jimmies who are overwhelmed with the snack selection out there. I've spoken to some myself, and this is exactly what they would want, for the right price. * As above, we're looking into the high-end snack option, but it's a major pivot and major investment. It's also a very saturated market, specifically if we are looking to target woman. (ie Naturebox, like you said).* I think that bro's are the hungriest bunch there is. And they're an untapped market. Who knows how are they'll be to penetrate (that sounds wrong...) :(* We're working on the look of the site. It's in MVP state, and we put it out here to get that kind of feedback. We need more pictures of people, we need pictures of the box contents, we need to build a look.

It has major flaws that Congress has failed to address. Click here to get the number to call, and retweet this if you're on Twitter.We've learned together how mass surveillance is censorship -- think of how often you've censored yourself since learning about the NSA's and other government programs. No open society has its government and the largest corporations monitor everyone's actions.  They're breaking the law, but trying to make it status quo.Today's the day to send a message to governments of the world that you're against mass surveillance and wont be fooled by fake fixes. Click here to take action and share.This bill is bad already, and theyre about to open it up for amendments, where it could get even worse. Heres the key issues:It  does almost nothing for mass surveillance: NSA can still access most of  our call and Internet data through loopholes; it also reauthorizes the PATRIOT Act. [1]Congress is trying to sneak in an amendment similar to SOPA's sister bill, ""the Bieber bill,  making streaming copyrighted content a felony, even videos of people singing cover songs!!! [2]CISA / CISPA, which would allow companies to openly violate privacy law and share our data might get added. [3] It's also possible that some of the amendments being considered could make the bill a little better, but even if that happens, it will still fail to be a net positive for privacy. This organization stands and fights for free speech in the digital age. We want to see a real NSA reform bill pass, but this isnt that. Lets all say loudly that the USA Freedom Act doesnt go far enough, so that next time Congress tries to fix this problem, they know were watching closely.P.S.

In 2009, two of the three went bankrupt (GM and Chrysler), and the third is up to its eyeballs in debt.

It is not surprising if you think about the 2000 or so companies that went bankrupt and discount all the money they invested, it is pretty easy to imagine how three companies cannot make enough money to make up for all those other companies that went bankrupt.EDIT: To add some more. There is a big difference between what a ""good business"" means for consumers, employees, management, and shareholders. There is a big difference between accounting profit, free cash flow, and what shareholders actually get. The auto industry made an incredible amount of money for a lot of people. The middle class was built by manufacturers like the auto companies. A lot of owners of failed businesses make incredible amounts of money because they were also management at the business - it's the management side that made them rich, now the ownership side, but being an owner allowed them to install themselves as management, the passive partners (aka shareholders) might not do so well. Take a more modern example: Research in Motion. You have to admit that the Blackberry is one of the most incredible innovations this decade. It made an incredible amount of money for a lot of people. It posted a ton of accounting profits, management got paid a lot of bonuses, employees got a lot of money, and consumers were extremely happy. Then the Blackberry got displaced by the iPhone. What do investors have? They never got paid a penny in dividend and the stock price went all the way back down to the levels before Blackberry became popular. It's like it never happened! And this is one of the greatest tech products of the last decade. Once you understand this, you will realize that there is a big difference in what ""good business"" means for each party involved, and how being a ""good business"" for one party might not be a good for another. The number of eyeballs valuation is a great metric for how well the consumers, employees, and management will do. I don't think it is such a great metric for how well the owners of the business will do. The autos created a lot of net wealth for many parties, but didn't do so great as a business for the owners (GM, Chrysler, and Ford did okay, but you never heard of the other thousands for a reason).",Facebook,,1,,0,,,,"> Facebook can have 900m pairs of eyes. Doesn't mean they will have a lot of money.That's pretty much exactly my point.Worth must be based on *something*, that's why we have things like P/E ratios and shit, to help the market decide valuation. But my point was that FB apparently made ~$1B last year, and suddenly they're supposed to be worth 100x that when they go public? It never added up.And my statement above was born of the fact that FB's product is its 900m users (plus whatever perceived growth) and their customers are companies who want to hock their goods at those users (and other things like selling user data to market research companies or whatever else, but you get the idea). You can look at a car company's ability to get product to market and selling that product and making a profit to guide your hand on stock valuation. But how can anyone say that FB's 900m users (+growth) will be able to be monetized in a way that makes the company worth $100b on the market?That's my issue with the whole thing. It simply doesn't make sense. It never did.On the other hand, I feel a similar way about Apple (""How can they sell the same product to the same group of people every year and that not make the market nervous?"") but I've been completely wrong about them for a few years now. They've just been inexplicably bulletproof.I'm not saying I'm right, I'm just saying that the FB thing blows my mind.",Facebook,,3,,-1,,,,"The valuation is very difficult for me to swallow as well.

Facebook has a de facto monopoly on internet-based social networking. The car industry has seen a lot of profitability problems because of fierce competition.and increased complexity requiring larger and larger investments.

Time will tell.",Facebook,,0,,0,,,,"Every industry goes through those cycles when new technologies/inventions are created. The number of companies doing ""x"" can reach into the hundreds. However as the years progress, some of that number will actually be making the product well and buy-out the other guys. Or the other guys simply go bankrupt and leave the market entirely.For every major product, you always end with a handful of companies doing ""x"" once a technology matures, unless those companies are being propped up by an external source. The American airline industry during the Cold War was propped up in this way by the Federal Government in order to maintain a military objective. Once the threat ended, the artificial propping ended and the extraneous companies either went under or were acquired. That being said, comparing the industry boom-bust cycle to Facebook's current monopoly doesn't make sense. The tech sector is much more fluid than traditional manufacturing, and the big guys (MS, FB, GOOG, etc.) and companies like those tend to just grow bigger over time by acquiring several small ideas and properties to enhance their own business in some unique way.",Facebook,,1,,1,,,,"Yeah, the point I was trying to make is that 1) the car industry has been very big for a long time, with a profitability that has varied in time. The market is simply huge. 2) Facebook is operating in an industry that is (as you point out) very fluid. OTOH, once there is a dominant player, the network effect is in their favour: the fact that so many people are using Facebook is a direct advantage, since almost everyone you know has an account. The competitors have to find a niche first, and then make inroads into the mainstream. It will happen sometime, but anyone can spend a lot of money failing, too.",Facebook,,2,,1,,,,"I don't think it is flawed at all. People perceive a monopoly, Facebook's moat hasn't been tested yet. People perceived monopolies in the auto and in the airline industry too back then too, the moats got penetrated and you were left with a competitive industry. AOL had the monopoly on ""internet-based social networking"" before Facebook. If you wanted to IM your friends online in the U.S. you had to use AIM, you pretty much had no choice. They made money through display ads on the instant messaging client. But now their monopoly is gone now and none of my friends use AIM any more. Palm had the monopoly on hand held computing (what we now know as ""smart phones""). Now they are gone and Apple (who only made desktop computers back then) are the dominant company.I'm not saying that Facebook cannot become the next Microsoft (despite all the hate for Microsoft, they consistently grew profits by about 10% over the last decade and Google only makes a small fraction of what Microsoft makes) or something, but having the dominant market share with very little profit doesn't mean that it is a natural transition to having the dominant market share and a large profit. Facebook made a $1B last year. They spent $1B to buy Instagram. They might make $2B next year, and they have to spend it buying something else to protect their position. How long before they can make $100B in cash that they can distribute back to shareholders? Because it is only then do the shareholders break even on the IPO price (and that is ignoring discounting).Again, I am not hating on Facebook. But these are legitimate valuation concerns that should be thought about for any business. Making money isn't easy. Defending a competitive advantage isn't easy (or cheap, as the $1B price tag on Instagram shows). I would not be surprised if the internet user data industry becomes a lot bigger than you or I can ever imagine, and nobody makes good money on it. There are many many industries where things revolutionize the world, but the benefit goes to the consumers and employees, not the owners. The auto and airline industry are examples. The drug industry is another example (curing cancer isn't profitable, but Viagra is profitable). Being ""HUGE"" and being profitable are two very different things. It's easy to get carried away and assume that those go hand in hand.",Facebook,,12,,-1,,,,"It's an apples to oranges comparison.  Car companies and airlines are bad investments because there is a large amount of competition which causes low profit margins.  Both purchases (cars and plane tickets) are infrequent events (unless you're a consultant you're not flying daily/weekly and no one buys a car every month.)  When each service or product is essentially the same the consumer will generally go for the lower priced product or the product perceived to have better value.  It makes both the auto industry and the airline business very cut throat.  Facebook has neither of those problems.It would be much closer to compare Facebook to Coke.  I think even that analogy isn't that great because Facebook has yet to establish a long term brand and durable competitive advantage.  Facebook's main asset among its users is that EVERYONE is using it.  If someone signs up for a social network, they're going to sign up for Facebook because that's what everyone is using.  Think about the time and effort involved in creating a new social network and providing the amount of buzz that would be needed to get a critical mass of users.  Not only would your idea have to be a better product, but that product would also have to have an insane swell of support to overcome Facebook.Now this isn't to say that Facebook is going to do well in the long run, but I think it is very well positioned as a company.  They regrettably have too much hype and are overvalued.  However, there is a lot of room for revenue growth, but they need a solid strategy to take advantage of their current user base.",Facebook,,2,,1,,,,"Well, to be fair - Facebook is at a turning point.  The IPO is similar to the Google IPO - the company has a massive user-base and a decent revenue-stream... and has suddenly been handed a gigantic wad of cash.The question is how it will exploit that cash.  Google went from being Search and Gmail to invading the world of cellphones with Android OS and now buying Motorola.  They blew a fat wad of IPO cash on buying Youtube.Facebook's IPO was less modest than Google - the stock was overvalued.  But like Google, it has a massive userbase, including the hard-to-switch older users.  Fickle teenagers and geeks and university students are easy pickins' for the Next Big Thing.  Soccer moms and retirees are the real challenge - they're hard to get, but once you get them they're customers for life.  That's how Hotmail and Yahoo persist - the die-hards.  Myspace and LJ and all those other companies never succeeded here.Facebook and Google both have those.  Facebook is *the* social media platform just like Google is *the* search platform.  Facebook may screw up and lose a bunch of their younger userbase someday, but it will take a *decade* of mismanagement to really destroy their core customerbase.   They're safe.But either way, Facebook's future isn't going to be about how they hold onto their existing customers, but about how they branch out and integrate into larger markets.

How many other programs besides the web browser do people open? I'd guess that on an average day most people today don't open anything but IE/Chrome/Firefox. We're sitting in about 1990 in terms of web platform development.

People seemed to not understand that recent developments have suggested that getting more likes from legitimate FB ads can actually DECREASE engagement.(Note: This is not necessarily covering buying ads on FB which link to an off-FB page.)This shorter explanation below actually comes from 2 videos I watched by Derek Muller of the YouTube channel, Veritasium. He explains it much better and has evidence to back up what I state here as a given. The 2 videos I linked below explain it better, but I'll try to give a TL;DW.1. FB has stated that the reach of your page will drop over time. As time passes, a shrinking percentage of the people who liked your page will see your posts.2. There are click farms where people set up fake accounts and will have those accounts like your page for a fee. In order to not be flagged as fake, those fake accounts must also like 100s or other random pages. A guy who has 1000 fake accounts can't have them all like the exact same pages of people who have paid him. So each account click on legit pages to hide the patterns of liking pages which have paid for likes.3. One of the best resources for those fake accounts to find pages to like are ads, legitimate FB ads.4. If you pay FB for legitimate and honest ads, a number of the likes you get will not be from legitimate people in your target demographic. They will be from fake accounts, pretending to be in your target demographic in order to hide their fakeness.5. Over time as you continue to post ads, a larger percentage of your likes will be fake accounts. As your organic reach diminishes, not only will fewer people see your posts, but a growing percentage of them will be fake accounts that will never interact with your business.So it is a one-two punch. Your population of FB likes becomes more and more poisoned and the number of people seeing your posts becomes lower and lower--which includes those poisoned posts! Also remember that these fake accounts who like pages to hide their activity may have to like 100s of pages a day. The average FB user likes about 40 - 60 pages ever. So those fake accounts are going to come across your ads WAY more often than legit users.Here is the first Veritasium video (9 mins) which talks about your reach declining over time and doesn't totally address what I said above, but gives background. The second video (7 mins) talks specifically about how buying ads can hurt you.There was also an HN discussion on this.tl;rd: FB admitted it is reducing your page's reach over time and FB ""fake like farms"" are poisoning the user base, so over time, fewer legit accounts will see your posts.EDIT: Fixed list formatting",Facebook,,65,,0,,,,I wonder if FB will have to release a means to allow page owners to block people from liking their pages in response to this.

His original likes were actually fans who wanted to be reached with new posts.This is in contrast to the current climate where pages gather likes instead of fans. The main difference being that his original fans were saying they wanted updates vs recent likes who are just saying they like whatever image Veritasium chose to push out via ads.In the former he should get nearly 100% reach because that's what people wanted. In the latter to be able to reach 15% in perpetuity after the initial ad buy isn't so bad.I mean do we really think that clicking like on a picture of a cool t-shirt equates to being a fan of whoever paid to put the image on our news feed?

The worst thing that could come out of this in my opinion is for facebook to take public action against non engagement accounts. If that happens then you're going to get wordpress comment spam fake likes which will be 10x worse.Instead if they silently reduce the negative impact on reach from fake accounts but do nothing to stop fake accounts (people will always sell likes) you will have a system where your reach is tested against not only real people but real people who are known to produce engagement.Everyone wins because your posts aren't tested against fake people or even real people who don't engage.

Of course, my close friends still communicated with me through texting and Snapchat, but group messaging is really where Facebook kills the competition.

Snapchat is great for casually keeping in touch, but doesn't encourage detailed discussions. The only other messaging client I continuously use is iMessage/texting.

Now, I have only added 30 or so friends: all of whom are close friends or colleagues at my university.

While I have a contact page on my site, everybody knows Twitter and Facebook can be publicity killers and makers when it comes to public interaction.

Basically, likes and publicity is only good if it targets your audience.  Anything else is simply diluting your ability to actually engage your target audience and you'll be spending a lot of money to reach an audience that doesn't care.Have the FB page, you'll probably get two types of people:1) Spammers.  You'll get people who like your page on the hopes that you like them back. Unless it's someone in your industry, you should probably just ignore these.  Chances are they'll eventually unlike you anyways since you're not returning the ""favor""2) Legitimate traffic.
