"I was on it but have since closed my account. Overall it's nice and simple, but it doesn't add anything to my life.

"its actually not that bad. i got an inv from a friend. obviously its not super active because its still in beta, so not many people. but the interface on mobile is rather intuitive. once you login, you have ""3 screens"" (it usually starts on the middle one which is the 'feed'). you can switch between screens by swiping left or right. far left screen is your base area, it shows all your friends, who you follow, and allows you to filter between 'friends' and 'noise'. i.e you can set people to different circles. say you have friends you want to see whats up with. put them in friends. but you also have companies you want to follow (lets go with a circlejerk subject, like Tesla, or SpaceX): you can put them in 'noise'. so you can filter between friends and whatever yet none of those people know how you filter them. middle screen shows the feed you have applied. right screen allows you to message people. its similar to twitter by using an @ symbol. it seems like a combination of twitter and facebook. and I actually like it.also, and this is a *huge* point: **THE FEED IS VIEWED IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.** so much better.

It would but that's not the point. If you contact customer services you get the wall of corporate policy quoting indifference. You don't speak to a person that can do anything about your issue. You get a person who is trained to politely deflect you until you give up rather than solve anything. If the corporation contacts you then it gets you as an individual to target for its carefully designed 'viral' marketing campaign.

"From ello.co:> This information is anonymous and aggregated. Before information about you is stored on the Google servers, your IP address is stripped and anonymized. This means that it is very difficult for anyone (including Ello and Google) to trace the data that Google stores back to any one user. We can see how people are using Ello in general, but not what you are doing in particular.I think this is bullshit when advertising is all about tracking and identifying users by fingerprinting. To be clear, a social network like Facebook does not need to know your name  - they already know who you are. They know this because they have the social graph around you, which email addresses are in your mailbox, which people you know, with whom you communicate. Fingerprinting works extremely well. They do not need to know your name. Also, Facebook has very successfully employed a tactic of salami-slicing where privacy settings are loosened, a bit more, after some critic tightened a bit, then loosened again, and so on.ello's management might say they are not going to use advertising, but because it is a company, they will eventually need to make money, and this will be either advertising or selling user's data, or both, as these are the only business models which work in this realm.The only way this could be avoided is by a social network which is **not** owned by a company, and has **no** need to make money. A distributed system like Usenet or IRC worked, or like Diaspora.

"I actually think their long term business strategy is interesting. It's sort of like a P2Win MMO, but applied to social networking. Their success really depends on how badly they gimp the basic service in order to make the add-on modules attractive.My guess is, it'll get pretty gimped pretty quickly as hosting costs mount. $1/month for photo uploads, $2/month for video, $1/month for unlimited ""wall"" posts, etc. Then it will transition to pay for a pretty UI and for custom colors/borders/icons.

"I suspect I may have been one, but no one will ever know. I experienced Facebook getting much more combative and I was seeing more and more posts regarding controversial topics that descended into flame wars. I just attributed it to the direction Facebook was moving in at the time. I've also always struggled with Facebook allowing me to have my news feed show all posts chronologically. The setting moved around over time but it always seemed to ""work"" even if only temporarily. That is until the time I finally ""quit"" Facebook when no matter what I tried to do my news feed was random, incomplete, and non-chronological.I eventually quit using Facebook when they announced the auto-playing video ads. By quitting I mean I deleted the app off my phone and stopped visiting on a regular basis. At first I had set up automatic cross posting from twitter and would still log in to respond to any replies I got.  When I would log in I would still see all the negativity on my news feed and so I eventually got fed up with Facebook and disabled crossposting and thus had very little reason to log in.At that point I started getting lots of emails from Facebook letting me know all the wonderful things going on  that I was missing out on. By this point I would only log in to RSVP for events and other very occasional reasons. This was when I started to notice all of the cool things my friends were doing. It was like my news feed had been under seige and the siege had been lifted. I found myself getting sucked back in and it was almost enough to drag me back, but I had settled in to using twitter enough that I was fine leaving Facebook behind. Today was the first time in month that I posted to Facebook and it was only to share this article. I'm ready now to delete my account, or at least delete everything in it (posts, photos, friends) and just leave a link to my twitter account so people can get in touch if they want.**TL;DR: My timeline got really negative and drove me out. After being away for several months the negativity ceased, but I don't care.

"Here is the email I just got from FFTF explaining how this Act is bullshit;Today, two years after we learned about the US government's massive surveillance programs that target every Internet user in the world, the Senate goes to vote on a bill that's supposed to end them. But it's a wolf in sheep's clothing so far; as written, it does not protect free speech in the digital age.We need you to help make sure USA Freedom does not move forward tonight. It has major flaws that Congress has failed to address. Click here to get the number to call, and retweet this if you're on Twitter.We've learned together how mass surveillance is censorship -- think of how often you've censored yourself since learning about the NSA's and other government programs. No open society has its government and the largest corporations monitor everyone's actions.  They're breaking the law, but trying to make it status quo.Today's the day to send a message to governments of the world that you're against mass surveillance and wonÛªt be fooled by fake fixes. Click here to take action and share.This bill is bad already, and theyÛªre about to open it up for amendments, where it could get even worse. HereÛªs the key issues:It  does almost nothing for mass surveillance: NSA can still access most of  our call and Internet data through loopholes; it also reauthorizes the PATRIOT Act. [1]Congress is trying to sneak in an amendment similar to SOPA's sister bill, ""the Bieber bill,Û  making streaming copyrighted content a felony, even videos of people singing cover songs!!! [2]CISA / CISPA, which would allow companies to openly violate privacy law and share our data might get added. [3] It's also possible that some of the amendments being considered could make the bill a little better, but even if that happens, it will still fail to be a net positive for privacy. This organization stands and fights for free speech in the digital age. We want to see a real NSA reform bill pass, but this isnÛªt that. LetÛªs all say loudly that the USA Freedom Act doesnÛªt go far enough, so that next time Congress tries to ÛÏfixÛ this problem, they know weÛªre watching closely.P.S. Here's the full letter opposing USA Freedom we signed onto with Firedoglake, CREDO,  Sunlight Foundation, and whistleblowers William Binney, Daniel Ellsberg, and more:http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2014/09/15/civil-liberties-advocates-organizations-and-whistleblowers-tell-congress-to-oppose-the-usa-freedom-act[1] Wheeler, Marcy. ÛÏWhy I DonÛªt Support USA Freedom ActÛ.

He asked if I had a portfolio, and I said I had some of my work from college online, so he took me to a computer and we looked at that for a while, and basically I gave him the full shpiel.After talking for maybe 10 minutes or so, he said something along the lines of, ""Well, let's find someone to interview you,"" (to my confusion, because I thought he was interviewing me) and he basically knocked on the CEO's door and was like, ""Hey man, this guy wants an interview."" He kinda prodded me on inside and then I had to do it all over again. It was good practice.

"Why would you reference Batman as pro-war propaganda? I feel like you haven't actually seen the movies. As far as Hollywood being a cancer, again I feel like your connection to the process and the product are so far removed that you can't really accurately comment. Everyone should hate DRM. Because at its core it aknowledges that the consumer and the producer can't have an honest relationship when it comes to digital content. It's a flawed outlook and every **major** supplier that's gone against it has been successful. That doesn't mean the current system of getting stuff made is completely ass-backwards and a cancer on art. It's fun and easy to hate on the industry, but I know that if they didn't have such a strong filter what would be showing up on the Silverscreen would feel like you shoulda just stayed home, saved your $10, and watched Youtube clips of idiots. Their business practices are slow to change, but that's the nature of any billion dollar industry. This is not meant to be an endorsement of SOPA or Protect IP, but I think we should all admit that while Hollywood is often full of shit shows, and recycled garbage it is a far better situation than if [this whiny bitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MA0eW8yyw) and his Youtube kin were given time on the Silverscreen. I honestly don't care all that much about the legislation.

"I guess my point of view is that if domain seizing becomes a very prominent thing than proxies become a prominent thing amongst piraters - not that they already aren't, but I'm of the belief that whatever technology legislators embrace for combating piracy, pirates embrace an equally effective converse technology. As usual there will be a lot of unsuspecting American citizens hurt by SOPA but eventually the people who have made torrents successful for the average Internet user will be able to make proxies, hidden downloads, and mirrors extremely user-friendly and easy-to-use for the public. As far as I'm concerned combatting piracy through legislation rather than business practices is opening pandora's box. Right now it's possible to make your ISP see nothing but bandwidth, it's difficult to set-up, and a pain to maintain, but if content providers want to wage war, they should be prepared to lose, and lose hard.

"They already do, it is just sneaky how it is done.  They have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country.  They do this by setting up particular legislation and shutting down public options (and anything else that might cut out administration and executive profits).  They don't need to directly tax us in order to keep an unreasonable amount of money flowing to corporate executives and wealthy share holders.  That is without even getting into pharmaceutics and prohibition legislation.One way they could easily keep money flowing to Hollywood, would be an additional tax refund that applies to ""legitimate"" entertainment costs.Or perhaps doing as Canada does and adding taxes to storage media.  They can also continue to cut web freedom, options and bandwidth.Every bit of legislation I see come down the pipe (with only a couple of notable exceptions, such as dadt) has been about protecting profits for the top of the economic pile, at the expense of everyone else.EDIT:  I would also like to mention that our taxes already fund healthcare, and in fact, we pay so much that we could have a universal system already just with the money we spend via taxes.

"> They have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country. Yes, and it really sucks, but you kinda have to buy health care ... you can skip it and hope to not get sick, but sooner or later you will. You don't need to buy entertainment though. And if you do buy it, you can always vote with your money. Stop going to movie theaters, stop buying or even renting DVDs ... stick to one cable provider or Netflix on demand or something and it will hurt them.> an additional tax refund A tax refund is just a tax refund, if you don't give them your money there will be nothing to tax anyway.> taxes to storage media.Yes, some countries do that, and I think it's OK in principle ... the problem is that I doubt that we can find a fair way to distribute that revenue. It's still peanuts though, especially today when we don't really buy that much media anymore. When is the last time you bought a blank optical disc? It's been years for me! But anyway I doubt that such a measure would stand a chance of passing in the US.

"Valuation based on number of users is retarded. Virtually every American drives or will drive a car. But the history of the auto industry as a business has been absolutely terrible. You had about 2000 auto companies at the beginning of the car boom, and only 3 survived (GM, Chrysler, and Ford). In 2009, two of the three went bankrupt (GM and Chrysler), and the third is up to its eyeballs in debt. The same is true with the airline industry, which is basically a revolving door of bankruptcies. Cars and planes certainly revolutionized the world, I doubt Facebook will have as big of an impact as those inventions.

"I've read it before. It is not surprising if you think about the 2000 or so companies that went bankrupt and discount all the money they invested, it is pretty easy to imagine how three companies cannot make enough money to make up for all those other companies that went bankrupt.EDIT: To add some more. There is a big difference between what a ""good business"" means for consumers, employees, management, and shareholders. There is a big difference between accounting profit, free cash flow, and what shareholders actually get. The auto industry made an incredible amount of money for a lot of people. The middle class was built by manufacturers like the auto companies. A lot of owners of failed businesses make incredible amounts of money because they were also management at the business - it's the management side that made them rich, now the ownership side, but being an owner allowed them to install themselves as management, the passive partners (aka shareholders) might not do so well. Take a more modern example: Research in Motion. You have to admit that the Blackberry is one of the most incredible innovations this decade. It made an incredible amount of money for a lot of people. It posted a ton of accounting profits, management got paid a lot of bonuses, employees got a lot of money, and consumers were extremely happy. Then the Blackberry got displaced by the iPhone. What do investors have? They never got paid a penny in dividend and the stock price went all the way back down to the levels before Blackberry became popular. It's like it never happened! And this is one of the greatest tech products of the last decade. Once you understand this, you will realize that there is a big difference in what ""good business"" means for each party involved, and how being a ""good business"" for one party might not be a good for another. The number of eyeballs valuation is a great metric for how well the consumers, employees, and management will do. I don't think it is such a great metric for how well the owners of the business will do. The autos created a lot of net wealth for many parties, but didn't do so great as a business for the owners (GM, Chrysler, and Ford did okay, but you never heard of the other thousands for a reason).",Facebook,1337869219,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rtlec,1,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",0
"> Facebook can have 900m pairs of eyes. Doesn't mean they will have a lot of money.That's pretty much exactly my point.Worth must be based on *something*, that's why we have things like P/E ratios and shit, to help the market decide valuation. But my point was that FB apparently made ~$1B last year, and suddenly they're supposed to be worth 100x that when they go public? It never added up.And my statement above was born of the fact that FB's product is its 900m users (plus whatever perceived growth) and their customers are companies who want to hock their goods at those users (and other things like selling user data to market research companies or whatever else, but you get the idea). You can look at a car company's ability to get product to market and selling that product and making a profit to guide your hand on stock valuation. But how can anyone say that FB's 900m users (+growth) will be able to be monetized in a way that makes the company worth $100b on the market?That's my issue with the whole thing. It simply doesn't make sense. It never did.On the other hand, I feel a similar way about Apple (""How can they sell the same product to the same group of people every year and that not make the market nervous?"") but I've been completely wrong about them for a few years now.

The American airline industry during the Cold War was propped up in this way by the Federal Government in order to maintain a military objective. Once the threat ended, the artificial propping ended and the extraneous companies either went under or were acquired. That being said, comparing the industry boom-bust cycle to Facebook's current monopoly doesn't make sense. The tech sector is much more fluid than traditional manufacturing, and the big guys (MS, FB, GOOG, etc.) and companies like those tend to just grow bigger over time by acquiring several small ideas and properties to enhance their own business in some unique way.",Facebook,1337846236,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rr4c5,1,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",1
"Yeah, the point I was trying to make is that 1) the car industry has been very big for a long time, with a profitability that has varied in time. The market is simply huge. 2) Facebook is operating in an industry that is (as you point out) very fluid. OTOH, once there is a dominant player, the network effect is in their favour: the fact that so many people are using Facebook is a direct advantage, since almost everyone you know has an account. The competitors have to find a niche first, and then make inroads into the mainstream. It will happen sometime, but anyone can spend a lot of money failing, too.",Facebook,1337847367,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rr8ho,2,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",1
"I don't think it is flawed at all. People perceive a monopoly, Facebook's moat hasn't been tested yet. People perceived monopolies in the auto and in the airline industry too back then too, the moats got penetrated and you were left with a competitive industry. AOL had the monopoly on ""internet-based social networking"" before Facebook. If you wanted to IM your friends online in the U.S. you had to use AIM, you pretty much had no choice. They made money through display ads on the instant messaging client. But now their monopoly is gone now and none of my friends use AIM any more. Palm had the monopoly on hand held computing (what we now know as ""smart phones""). Now they are gone and Apple (who only made desktop computers back then) are the dominant company.I'm not saying that Facebook cannot become the next Microsoft (despite all the hate for Microsoft, they consistently grew profits by about 10% over the last decade and Google only makes a small fraction of what Microsoft makes) or something, but having the dominant market share with very little profit doesn't mean that it is a natural transition to having the dominant market share and a large profit. Facebook made a $1B last year. They spent $1B to buy Instagram. They might make $2B next year, and they have to spend it buying something else to protect their position. How long before they can make $100B in cash that they can distribute back to shareholders? Because it is only then do the shareholders break even on the IPO price (and that is ignoring discounting).Again, I am not hating on Facebook. But these are legitimate valuation concerns that should be thought about for any business. Making money isn't easy. Defending a competitive advantage isn't easy (or cheap, as the $1B price tag on Instagram shows). I would not be surprised if the internet user data industry becomes a lot bigger than you or I can ever imagine, and nobody makes good money on it. There are many many industries where things revolutionize the world, but the benefit goes to the consumers and employees, not the owners. The auto and airline industry are examples. The drug industry is another example (curing cancer isn't profitable, but Viagra is profitable). Being ""HUGE"" and being profitable are two very different things. It's easy to get carried away and assume that those go hand in hand.",Facebook,1337817367,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rlwdt,12,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",-1
"It's an apples to oranges comparison.  Car companies and airlines are bad investments because there is a large amount of competition which causes low profit margins.  Both purchases (cars and plane tickets) are infrequent events (unless you're a consultant you're not flying daily/weekly and no one buys a car every month.)  When each service or product is essentially the same the consumer will generally go for the lower priced product or the product perceived to have better value.  It makes both the auto industry and the airline business very cut throat.  Facebook has neither of those problems.It would be much closer to compare Facebook to Coke.  I think even that analogy isn't that great because Facebook has yet to establish a long term brand and durable competitive advantage.  Facebook's main asset among its users is that EVERYONE is using it.  If someone signs up for a social network, they're going to sign up for Facebook because that's what everyone is using.  Think about the time and effort involved in creating a new social network and providing the amount of buzz that would be needed to get a critical mass of users.  Not only would your idea have to be a better product, but that product would also have to have an insane swell of support to overcome Facebook.Now this isn't to say that Facebook is going to do well in the long run, but I think it is very well positioned as a company.  They regrettably have too much hype and are overvalued.  However, there is a lot of room for revenue growth, but they need a solid strategy to take advantage of their current user base.",Facebook,1337826824,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rntqo,2,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",1
"Well, to be fair - Facebook is at a turning point.  The IPO is similar to the Google IPO - the company has a massive user-base and a decent revenue-stream... and has suddenly been handed a gigantic wad of cash.The question is how it will exploit that cash.  Google went from being Search and Gmail to invading the world of cellphones with Android OS and now buying Motorola.  They blew a fat wad of IPO cash on buying Youtube.Facebook's IPO was less modest than Google - the stock was overvalued.  But like Google, it has a massive userbase, including the hard-to-switch older users.  Fickle teenagers and geeks and university students are easy pickins' for the Next Big Thing.  Soccer moms and retirees are the real challenge - they're hard to get, but once you get them they're customers for life.  That's how Hotmail and Yahoo persist - the die-hards.  Myspace and LJ and all those other companies never succeeded here.Facebook and Google both have those.  Facebook is *the* social media platform just like Google is *the* search platform.  Facebook may screw up and lose a bunch of their younger userbase someday, but it will take a *decade* of mismanagement to really destroy their core customerbase.   They're safe.But either way, Facebook's future isn't going to be about how they hold onto their existing customers, but about how they branch out and integrate into larger markets.  Yes, they'll need to work on getting more advertising revenue out of the existing customerbase, but if Zuckerberg has a brain in his head he'll be gentle about that.",Facebook,1337800179,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4ri01e,57,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",2
"I have to disagree with the point on the core customer base. Hotmail and Yahoo are both primarily email clients. No matter how many people leave, you can still send and receive emails to all the people you know (there's cross-compatibility between clients).

"I'd say it makes it HARDER to leave, but once there's a crack in the dam, you can bet on the fact that the end is near. Operating systems used to be much more proprietary. In 1999, it was a pain in the ass to switch from Windows to Mac because none of your applications would work, and most of your files would be incompatible. Alternative OSes like BeOS and NeXT flopped not because they were crap but because they lacked a software base. The web equalized things because suddenly all that mattered was having a web browser. How many other programs besides the web browser do people open? I'd guess that on an average day most people today don't open anything but IE/Chrome/Firefox. We're sitting in about 1990 in terms of web platform development. It's probably going to be at least 5 years (assuming we advance faster this time around) before there's legit cross-compatibility there, before Joe Schmo would have no problem migrating from Facebook over to something else.",Facebook,1337837093,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rpvrq,3,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",0

They're like commercials but with the ability to push them into a corner and ignore them. Or if you're even slightly above average in computers, remove them altogether.There's a digital advertising joke that I can't find to copy and paste here. I'll try to re-tell, but I'm not the greatest of writers...The CEO of a retail company that spends 1million+ per month on advertising walks into the marketing department. He walks up to the manager in charge of television advertising and bluntly asks ""What's our conversion rate?"" - The manager replies ""Well, we have the impression rate, the audience reach..."" - ""But you don't know the conversion rate."" says the CEO. The boss then asks the manager in charge of print advertising ""What's our conversion rate?"" - ""Well, we have the subscriber base and the estimated reach and this cool QR code and a unique link for peopl..."" ""That's not the conversion rate"" replies the boss. The CEO then asks the web manager in charge of PPC advertising and asks ""What's our conversion rate?!"" and the web manager replies ""It's about 10% currently..."" and the CEO quips back ""10%?!?!?!? That low?! You're fired!!!""....Point being - other forms of advertising may in theory perform better. But the data you get from digital advertising can not be matched. You can instantly find out whether a campaign is successful or not. Many businesses (including the one I work for) spends more than half of their marketing budget on digital advertising simply because it allows you to analyze what copy/images/campaigns/concepts work. And in my biased opinion - digital advertising performs better for many industries (pretty much anything in retail or lead-gen).**tl;dr** - sure, few people click on ads, but the cost is low, the execution is a million times quicker than any other type of advertising, and at least you know exactly how many people saw your ad!",Facebook,1337794300,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rglu5,12,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",0

"This annoyed me about the first bubble and advertising as well. For some reason when it comes to the web advertising, success is measured in clicks. Yet if you look in the real world there is no such metric, so ""possible"" views are the measure that ads get valued on. But you don't see people questioning the value of a billboard or TV ad as much as an internet ad, yet those do not have any measure of ""clicking"" metrics. What makes traditional advertising better than internet (other than ad blocking of course)?One of the major values of advertising throughout the years is merely ""name recognition"" (i.e., you are more likely to bye a brand that you are exposed to more than a unheard of brand) generated from ads, which is more or less accomplished by ""viewing"" ads alone - something that internet ads can still accomplish by views.That said I'm not defending Facebook's value, I just think the metric of ""clicks"" is a bias measure of value of ads, favoring traditional media over new.",Facebook,1337800189,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4ri04k,5,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",0

"I think if anything Facebook will unravel because they do tend to make some boneheaded decisions and they really and truly do not listen to users .  They killed a lot of features when they started the apps because they wanted to give developers a chance to compete but all it did was decentralize everything (I.E. Course search function split from one universal database to multiple apps) Now honestly who creates apps besides game companies or ad companies that just want to mine user data? There's been considerable backlash against some of their decisions but they just refuse to listen or take suggestions about what people actually want.  It really is just a few kids in a room coming up with whatever they want implementing it and never touching it again.

"This is ignoring the (somewhat notable) success of Facebook's app platform and digital currency. I don't know how many people buy Facebook Credits but I assume if companies like Zynga have been drowing in money due to microtransactions and advertising and Facebook have received a sizeable cut from each microtransaction sale, then surely this is a secondary source of income that can come close to, if not outright beat advertising.My only issue with the app platform and Facebook Credits is that the games that implement them are grindy as fuck and generally quite shit in themselves. For example, any Zynga game sucks, usually has no further depth than ""click a few times, do a few things by clicking on objects"" and then realise you have limited turns or limited funds to do stuff and have to buy more Facebook Credits or add another fifteen friends or get to a certain rank or get a certain ingame achievement or set of achivements (gamification or cold hard cash) in order to progress further in the game.Once a developer uses the Facebook app platform to make something world class, and I don't mean a shitty Flash game that is about as fun as anything you'd see for free on Newgrounds, I'm talking a decent game, probably made using something like Unity3D or Java and using a browser-based system then I think the app platform could see some major income.",Facebook,1337796881,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/u0wzz/the_facebook_fallacy_facebook_is_not_only_on/c4rh7n6,2,"612 :: The Facebook Fallacy -- ""Facebook is not only on course to go bust, bu...",1

"This ""article"" is full of BS.> This past Friday it surfaced that Facebook started including user profile photos in ads run with in the Facebook network.Facebook has used user profile photos with their ads for a /long/ time. More than a year at least.The way this works is: * You become a fan of somebody or some product. * The owner of the fan page has the option of running ads on the facebook. * If the ads are displayed to your friends, they may see your profile image and something like ""Joe is a fan of ...."". * This feature is opt-out as described in the article.Which means that the following > you could end up with your photo(s) next to an online dating service ad or perhaps something as awkward as a Viagra ad.will only happen, if you beforehand have subscribed as a fan to the dating service or viagra seller.Furthermore, the ads are reviewed before activation, therefore the violating frase ""is now a hot single waiting for you"" would never make it through.EDIT: I don't know why some are downmodding this.

"I doubt it. If you can steal someone's identity from just knowing someone's name and birthdate then the US system sucks balls.Here you need to register first with the personal registration system and you then use that number (which is public information... it's just a number) to apply for everything else. Your number is linked to your address in a database. Whenever you apply for anything important, you give that number and your address. They then send a contract to your address which you then must sign and return. If there is any dispute then it will be impossible for the imposter to convince a court because even if they guessed your number and address they won't have been able to get your signature onto a document that was sent to your address, which would be required to prove that it was you.Obviously it's not 100% foolproof (you could for example break into someone's home, steal their mail, and forge their signature) but at least you don't have to go round trying to keep your birthdate secret just in case someone steals your entire identity from that one piece of information.The only reason the US doesn't do something similar is because they are too concerned about privacy. It's almost as if most US citizens honestly believe that the government don't actually already know their addresses.",Facebook,1248189441,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/92u1b/facebook_now_using_your_profile_image_in_online/c0b9l7k,1,595 :: Facebook now using your profile image in online dating banner ads.

They believe that if they defer the money for 5 or 10 years, they can make significantly more in investments than the extra 15% they will pay.I set these up for hedge funds all the time, or rather deal with the taxation after my clients lawyers set them up. There are pros and cons to to doing this, and there is no way you'd be sued for doing or not doing this.You can think it's wrong, but the government set up these treaties purposely to do this stuff - and to allow Irish corps to do things like that here to bring investment here.",Facebook,1386426568,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1satq0/facebook_offshores_239_billion_to_ireland_in/cdvtm2f,27,545 :: Facebook offshores $2.39 billion to Ireland in order to avoid tax - re...,0

"(I have no connection to Veritasium)There was a recent post here about how a startup was getting likes very cheaply. People seemed to not understand that recent developments have suggested that getting more likes from legitimate FB ads can actually DECREASE engagement.(Note: This is not necessarily covering buying ads on FB which link to an off-FB page.)This shorter explanation below actually comes from 2 videos I watched by Derek Muller of the YouTube channel, Veritasium. He explains it much better and has evidence to back up what I state here as a given. The 2 videos I linked below explain it better, but I'll try to give a TL;DW.1. FB has stated that the reach of your page will drop over time. As time passes, a shrinking percentage of the people who liked your page will see your posts.2. There are click farms where people set up fake accounts and will have those accounts like your page for a fee. In order to not be flagged as fake, those fake accounts must also like 100s or other random pages. A guy who has 1000 fake accounts can't have them all like the exact same pages of people who have paid him. So each account click on legit pages to hide the patterns of liking pages which have paid for likes.3. One of the best resources for those fake accounts to find pages to like are ads, legitimate FB ads.4. If you pay FB for legitimate and honest ads, a number of the likes you get will not be from legitimate people in your target demographic. They will be from fake accounts, pretending to be in your target demographic in order to hide their fakeness.5. Over time as you continue to post ads, a larger percentage of your likes will be fake accounts. As your organic reach diminishes, not only will fewer people see your posts, but a growing percentage of them will be fake accounts that will never interact with your business.So it is a one-two punch. Your population of FB likes becomes more and more poisoned and the number of people seeing your posts becomes lower and lower--which includes those poisoned posts! Also remember that these fake accounts who like pages to hide their activity may have to like 100s of pages a day. The average FB user likes about 40 - 60 pages ever. So those fake accounts are going to come across your ads WAY more often than legit users.Here is the first Veritasium video (9 mins) which talks about your reach declining over time and doesn't totally address what I said above, but gives background. The second video (7 mins) talks specifically about how buying ads can hurt you.There was also an HN discussion on this.tl;rd: FB admitted it is reducing your page's reach over time and FB ""fake like farms"" are poisoning the user base, so over time, fewer legit accounts will see your posts.EDIT: Fixed list formatting",Facebook,1393204931,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1yr398/why_buying_ads_from_facebook_to_get_more_likes_on/?ref=search_posts,65,65 :: Why buying ads from Facebook to get more likes on your FB page likely r...,0

Thats the issue though right?  Someone has demonstrated that paying to advertise on Facebook actually has negative value on your advertising on Facebook.  They've shown that at least one type of advertising is worse than not advertising at all(and not just on immediate ROI) and everyone seems to be talking about it.  They will have to do something.

"well the only way facebook would ever do anything is if it does affect their revenue or ad sales.

"I don't necessarily think there is a way to block them from the advertiser's standpoint. If a fake account is created saying it is in Cleveland, OH then likes a bunch of pages local to Cleveland, it looks legit. Of course if they then like hundreds of other random pages every week, that could be a flag to FB and they could disable the account.Maybe the advertiser could say ""don't display this ad to anyone who has liked more than 100 pages"". In many articles about this, journalists and bloggers theorize that anything FB did about this would acknowledge fraud & wold make advertising with them look bad, lead to declining revenue, etc.",Facebook,1393205538,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1yr398/why_buying_ads_from_facebook_to_get_more_likes_on/cfmzuyf,5,65 :: Why buying ads from Facebook to get more likes on your FB page likely r...,1
"A simple solution would be to weight each users impact on reach based on their past behavior.If you typically don't engage any posts then you won't be in the initial pool of people reached. If you typically do engage and you ignore only then would it have an impact on if the post gains traction or not.My opinion though is that Veritasium is a content creator who built a facebook page the old fashioned way. His original likes were actually fans who wanted to be reached with new posts.This is in contrast to the current climate where pages gather likes instead of fans. The main difference being that his original fans were saying they wanted updates vs recent likes who are just saying they like whatever image Veritasium chose to push out via ads.In the former he should get nearly 100% reach because that's what people wanted. In the latter to be able to reach 15% in perpetuity after the initial ad buy isn't so bad.I mean do we really think that clicking like on a picture of a cool t-shirt equates to being a fan of whoever paid to put the image on our news feed? It's more like a really low quality email list than anything.",Facebook,1393271264,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1yr398/why_buying_ads_from_facebook_to_get_more_likes_on/cfnm9zt,0,65 :: Why buying ads from Facebook to get more likes on your FB page likely r...,0

"Right and you said they could fake engagement easily. My point is there is no incentive for them bother unless you try to ban the accounts based on engagement. The worst thing that could come out of this in my opinion is for facebook to take public action against non engagement accounts. If that happens then you're going to get wordpress comment spam fake likes which will be 10x worse.Instead if they silently reduce the negative impact on reach from fake accounts but do nothing to stop fake accounts (people will always sell likes) you will have a system where your reach is tested against not only real people but real people who are known to produce engagement.Everyone wins because your posts aren't tested against fake people or even real people who don't engage.

"Disclaimer: I'm the head of media and strategy at a social media agency.The answer is... maybe.Click farms have found very sophisticated ways of gaming the system, so even finely targeted ads can be poisoned, so-to-speak.Off the bat, I'd say that a reach of 960k is still pretty wide.Also, while FB interest targeting can help narrow your targeting, it'll never be as effective as building an audience from a custom audience. If you've got a sizeable crm/newsletter email database, target them first.Also, I've seen good fan acquisition just from promoted posts.

"Sure. first, my assumption after creating a capsule is that you are providing a way to group together images and posts for a particular event. Hence the ""chat, photos and events"" bit. I also assume this is intended for events both small (poker night at a buddy's) and large (300+)As a person who organizes a fair number of public events (code camps, startup weekend, etc) we almost always have a PC hooked up to a projector or large screen showing the tweets for the event hashtag. ie: https://twitter.com/#!/search/iowacodecampSo adding these into the capsule makes sense to me. One could also make the leap that pulling in streams from facebook, flickr and picasa would be ideal too (maybe you already do this. I haven't used your app enough to know)Also, I don't want to upload or import an attendee list, for two reasons. first, my events are public. I have no clue who will sign up and attend. Second, I don't want to be responsible for any spam you may send. you basically haven't earned my trust yet. not that you've done anything wrong. it's just that I'm not sure why you need that list.Does that makes sense?btw, i really dig the address auto complete thing. After looking into it more, you might consider geocoding the users IP first so that google can base the results the autocomplete gives in the users area.

"Like many people, the only thing stopping me from leaving Facebook is the extent to which I'd miss out in my social life. I only rarely post status updates or photos, and I'm not very interested in my newsfeed which is largely full of people I don't know or care about.

I suspect email may come into play here.This would never be enough of a problem to create a huge business around, but I think it's an interesting one nonetheless.

"I recently opened a new Facebook account after having deleted mine in May.I rejoined Facebook for the same reasons you made for staying on Facebook: I felt left out of group messages among my friends, and I missed events that weren't relayed through mutual friends. Of course, my close friends still communicated with me through texting and Snapchat, but group messaging is really where Facebook kills the competition. To participate in these conversations, I needed to join Facebook again.Also, as a college student, Facebook plays a large role in communicating campus events and coordinating group projects/parties/meetings. I'm in a group for my class, my major, my extracurriculars, and my fellow teaching assistant staff. (In fact, the biggest reason I had for returning to Facebook was that my co-TAs coordinated via Facebook.) During my absence from Facebook, I didn't discover any other social platform that adequately covered Facebook's groups and group messaging. Snapchat is great for casually keeping in touch, but doesn't encourage detailed discussions. The only other messaging client I continuously use is iMessage/texting. Texting is great for one-on-one, in-depth communication, but it really fails at group messaging (especially when all your friends except one or two have iPhones). In all, I enjoyed my hiatus from Facebook, but ultimately needed to return. Now, I have only added 30 or so friends: all of whom are close friends or colleagues at my university. I rarely check my newsfeed; because I have few friends, Facebook pumps in extra content (e.g. ""John liked [insert buzzfeed post or random person's photo) that I don't want to see. (Honestly, it's startling to see how much I can see of non-friends' lives via Facebook.) I really only use the messaging and group features of Facebook now -- they are the features I could not replace elsewhere.End note: I'd recommend deleting your Facebook like I did. It will refresh your perspective on social communication in general, and if you choose to rejoin Facebook, you can start fresh, with no clutter from the past.",Facebook,1408232503,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2dqn5k/id_love_to_hear_your_thoughts_on_a_service_for/cjs9m5b,1,37 :: I'd love to hear your thoughts on a service for those looking to leave ...,2

You'll get people who like your page on the hopes that you like them back. Unless it's someone in your industry, you should probably just ignore these.  Chances are they'll eventually unlike you anyways since you're not returning the ""favor""2) Legitimate traffic.

You need to look at DATA.Do a quick search on Facebook marketing and Facebook ads and you'll see that when done properly, the return on investment can be ENORMOUS.Yes you'll need a Facebook fan page, but only to create the ads.I've used Facebook ads extensively, and the amount of people you can reach for the cost is absolutely amazing.Not to mention, they now do re-marketing! This is insanely effective. You can target ads to people's Facebook accounts who have recently visited YOUR SITE in the last 30 days. The return you get on these ads is incredible.The next time you base an important decision on how you feel about something, stop. Do a Google search, read the statistics.

"I meant ""your"" in the general sense, not you specifically.  But either way, you are simply not correct.  If investors have liquidation preference, assuming they *all* have liquidation preference at 1x, the exposure is $2b.

"I have zero faith in the board of facebook safeguarding employee equity, since I don't know any of the board members, nor am I an employee myself.However, it's just simple math.  $1b in cash and stock from a company with an $80b valuation doesn't even move the needle.

"What if out of the 80bn, 70bn goes to investors and founders, and 10bn is left for employees?  Would 1bn move the needle then?  Each individual employee is much more sensitive to this than each individual investor, considering that the ratio of their payout to their current net worth will be much lower.",Facebook,1334026441,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/s11g4/facebook_acquires_instagram/c4af39k,1,26 :: Facebook acquires Instagram,0
"No, it wouldn't, because it will get distributed roughly evenly.  Let's say the remaining 10b is divided equally amongst 2000 employees at $1/share (I know they have more employees, and it isn't divided equally, but it makes the math easier).  That gives each employee a value of $5m.  Now, let's give a billion dollars to instagram, and in order to do that, we create a billion shares.  That means now each share is worth $.987.  Now each employee is worth $4.935m, so the instagram acquisition cost them $65k, assuming your figures are accurate.No matter how you want to divide it, even under the worth scenarios, $1b for a company worth north of $80b, it doesn't really have an effect.",Facebook,1334032007,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/s11g4/facebook_acquires_instagram/c4ag6si,2,26 :: Facebook acquires Instagram,0

"ill disagree with all of you and say overall its not a great deal for facebook, but if its mostly stock than they came out the winner.1.  users on instagram probably exist on facebook so the users don't matter.2.  most people shared their photos on facebook already.3.  facebook bought a hipster brand and a fickle user base, already people threaten not to use it.  How many people will actually drop it we'll never really know, but just the indication that people are willing to drop it because of a purchase like this or its launch on competing platfroms from ios , just shows the usage is not that important to their most dedicated users. 4.  installs != daily active users.  this is the problem with mobile apps in general.  I've heard more android users installed just to see what the hype is about and remove instantly being dissapointed.Overall good for facebook because they acquired a talented team and removed competition of a photo sharing platform.",Facebook,1334009071,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/s11g4/facebook_acquires_instagram/c4abrfn,2,26 :: Facebook acquires Instagram,1
